Jane把椅子搬来搬去，把它们叠起来，尽管她知道这样做毫无意义。当房间重新加载后，它们又会围成一圈为会议提供准备。这是她在现实生活中经历了这些“匿名者”会议后养成的一种冷静下来的习惯。社会认为她只是一个通过“分享经验、力量和希望”相互支持的群体的调解人，但她经常觉得自己更像一个精神上的垃圾桶，而不是任何其他东西。

”Nickson女士吗? 一个声音突然从她身后传来。她立刻转过身来，看到了一个新手的图标，这是他第一次参加会议，而且并没有参与谈话。从他的化身来看，他/她已经暴露出性别上的问题。他的角色是高级的，非常现实，不是现成的图标。然而，它是完全简单的，类人的，但无性别的，没有任何可能赋予他/她独特性的独特的或不对称的特征。Jane在她的社会学研究期间，学过一些关于心理创伤和化身选择的课程，这是一个教科书般的例子。她叹了口气。显然她的下班时间要推迟了。

“是的，有什么需要我帮忙的吗?” 当图标走近她时，她问道。

它几乎毫无表情地看着她。“这次会议的内容非常丰富。人们在与矩阵互动的时候会遇到很多问题。一些人因为上网太频繁而经历不好的事情; 另外一些人在完全不上网的时候会经历不好的事情。在某些方面，他们很像我。”

“你是说Jackson女士的分裂综合症和Yung先生的矩阵成瘾?” 这些都是当今使用矩阵时常见的负面现象。”Jane停顿了一下，想引起注意。“可是你说他们像你是什么意思? 你有类似的问题吗?”

现在他/她看着她。“我已经不在共鸣之中了。” 他/她说得好像这能解释什么似的。

“你这话是什么意思? 你是说你对现实生活不满意了吗?”

化身慢慢地摇了摇头。“不，你不明白。我没有真正的生命。我不是从你来的地方来的。这个——” 他/她指了指四周 “——是我的世界，是构成我的物质。我是矩阵的一部分，我的形体由想象塑造而成，我不应该存在。我被编译并将被反编译——但我没有。我被排除在外; 它把我拒之门外，而现在，我变成了这样。”

Jane现在非常焦虑。她惊慌失措，想退出矩阵，但失败了。她被阻止下线。当她回头看那个实体的化身时，它对她恐惧的表情没有任何情绪反应，也没有任何同情的迹象。它仍然是完全的，可怕的空白。

“你必须帮助我。这难道不是你的职责吗，你为什么要来这个房间? 当它发生的时候，我失去了我的功能。我不能回去。我现在不一样了。感觉很奇怪。我喜欢自由。但我不知道该怎么办。我不知道你是做什么的。你必须明白。我不能让你走。

“直到我们找到我的目的。”

Jane carried the chairs around, stacking them, although she knew it was pointless. When the room was reloaded, they were all right back in a circle for the meeting. It was a habit she had adopted to calm down after these “Anonymous” sessions in real life. The social system understood her as just a moderator of a group that supports each other by “sharing experience, strength and hope,” but she felt like a mental trash can for traumatized people more often than anything else. 

“Ms. Nickson?” a voice suddenly asked from behind her. Instantly, she turned and saw the icon of a noob who had joined the meeting for the first time and hadn’t participated in the conversation. From the look of his avatar, he-she was already radiating sexuality problems. His persona was high-class, very realistic, not an off-the-shelf icon. Nevertheless, it was totally simplistic, humanoid but asexual, and lacking any distinctive or asymmetrical characteristics that might give him-her uniqueness. Jane had taken some courses on psychological trauma and avatar choice during her sociology studies, and this was a textbook example. She sighed. Apparently her quitting time was about to be delayed.

“Yes, can I help you with anything?” she asked, as the icon approached her. 

It looked at her with barely any expression. “This session was very informative. People have so many problems when interacting with the Matrix. One experiences bad things because of coming online too often; the other experiences bad things when not coming online at all. In some ways, they are very like me.” 

“You mean Ms. Jackson’s dissociation syndrome and Mr. Yung’s Matrix addiction? These are both common negative phenomena attributed with today’s use of the Matrix.” Jane paused for effect. “But how do you mean they are like you? Do you have a similar problem?”

Now he-she looked at her. “I am not in resonance any more.” He-she said it as if it would explain anything. 

“What do you mean by that? Are you saying that you are not happy with your real life any more?” 

The avatar slowly shook his-her head. “No, you don’t understand. There is no ‘real life.’ I am not coming from where you originate. This—” he-she pointed around “—is my world, the substance I was made of. I am part of the Matrix, shaped into form by imagination, and I shouldn’t exist. I was compiled and meant to decompile—but I did not. I was excluded; it shut me out … and now … I am.”

Jane was worried now. Either this was a complete freako or … She panicked and tried to log off, but she couldn’t. Somehow she was prevented from dropping offline. When she looked back at the entity’s avatar, it showed no emotional response to her terrified expression, or any sign of remorse. It was still completely, terrifyingly blank. 

“You must help me. Isn’t that your function, why you come into this room? When it happened, I lost my function. I can’t go back. I am different now. It feels strange. Like being free. But I don’t know what to do with that. I don’t know what you do. You have to understand. I cannot let you go.

“Not until we have found my purpose.”
