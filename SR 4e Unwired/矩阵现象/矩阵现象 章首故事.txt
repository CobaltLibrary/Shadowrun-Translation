这不是真实的。这几天你工作得太辛苦了，她想，同时用手摸索着那天早上买的镇定剂。她抑制住了转过身去盯着房间角落里的监控摄像头的欲望。她感觉那只电子眼正盯着她的后颈。

这是两个月前开始的: 当她经过时，摄像头会切换到她身上，当她使用电子设备时，它们的行为变得奇怪。她公寓里的自动烹饪机开始每天为两个人做晚餐，并且拒绝她重新设置它的任何尝试。

即便如此，这些还不是她经历过的最奇怪的事情。每当她在工作期间切换到完全VR模式时，她就会觉得有人藏在她访问的节点中，从一个节点跟踪她到另一个节点。当她挣扎着打开镇定剂瓶子时，她的手指开始颤抖。

“这不是真的。”她感到身后静止的镜头在凝视着她。当她仍然觉得有人在跟踪她时，她向MCT的矩阵安保官员Jonathan寻求帮助，请求他检查系统。也许有线索可以让她除掉那个混蛋。但Jonathan什么也没找到。

她打不开瓶子。汗水从她脸上流下来。办公室里的寂静似乎令人难以忍受。Jonathan什么也没找到，她开始相信问题是过去几个月的压力造成的。她预定了去加勒比联盟的假日旅行，但起飞前几小时她的航班被取消了。她飞机的导航系统已经崩溃，无法重新启动。航空公司声称这是某种蓄意破坏……

两天前情况变得更糟了。那天晚上她醒来，确信有人正坐在她的卧室里，但没有任何人在那里。没有人进入她的公寓，但有人侵入了她的PAN，修改了她的虚拟KittyTM程序，生成了一个没有脸的人类男性。这是她第一次讨厌矩阵和她无法关掉的赛博眼。

第二天，她再一次向Jonathan寻求帮助。也许他有合适的程序来干掉这个混蛋。作为替代，他在她的PAN上安装了IC程序。“下次，“他邪恶地咧着嘴笑着说，”他会大吃一惊的。”这是他最后一句话: 在回家的路上，他的车被黑了。它撞上了一辆卡车，他当场死亡。

一阵冷风从空调里吹来，吹在她身上。她盯着面前的显示器，浑身颤抖。当一个小图标闪烁起来，表示有消息进来时，她畏缩了一下。她紧张地打开邮件，眼中盈满泪水，读到里面只有一句话和签名: “你是我的。David”

“不!“她尖叫。”不可能是你! 不可能是你! 你死了! 你在崩溃中死了……”

It’s not real. You’ve worked too hard the past few days, she thought, her hands searching for the tranquilizers she had bought that morning. She fought the desire to turn and stare at the security cam in the corner of the room. She felt the digital eye focused on the back of her neck. 

It had started two months ago: cameras switching to her when she was passing by, electronic devices behaving strangely when she used them. The autocook in her apartment had started cooking dinner for two every day, resisting her every attempt to reset it.

Even so, these were not the strangest things she’d experienced. Every time she switched to full VR mode during her work, she had a feeling somebody was hiding in the nodes she visited, following her from one to the next. Her fingers began to shiver while she struggled to open the tranquilizer bottle. 

“It’s not real.” She felt the staring of the motionless lens behind her. When the feeling that somebody was stalking her hadn’t stopped, she had asked Jonathan, an MCT Matrix Security Officer, to check the system. Maybe there were traces she could use to get rid of that bastard. But Jonathan hadn’t found anything. 

She couldn’t open the bottle. Sweat ran down her face. The silence in the office seemed insufferable. When Jonathan hadn’t found anything, she started to believe that the problem was a result of the last months’ stress. She’d booked a holiday trip to the Caribbean League, but her flight was canceled a few hours before takeoff. The navigation system of her plane had crashed and couldn’t be restarted. The airline claimed it was some kind of sabotage…

Two days ago it had gotten worse. She woke up that night convinced that somebody was sitting in her bedroom, but no one had been there. Nobody had entered her apartment, but someone had hacked her PAN and modified her Virtual KittyTM program to generate a faceless human male. For the first time she hated the Matrix and her cybereyes that she couldn’t just switch off. 

The next day, she had asked Jonathan again if he could help her. Maybe he had the right programs to fry this fucking bastard. He installed an IC program on her PAN. “Next time,“ he said with an evil grin, ”he’ll find a nasty surprise.” Those words had been his last: On his way home, his car was hacked. It crashed into a truck, killing him instantly.

A cold breeze from the air conditioner touched her. Her whole body shivered as she stared at the monitor in front of her. She winced when a small icon flickered up and signaled an incoming message. Nervously she opened it, tears filling her eyes as she read the single sentence and the signature: “You belong to me. David”

“No!“ she screamed. ”It can’t be you! It just can’t be you! You died! You died during the Crash…”
