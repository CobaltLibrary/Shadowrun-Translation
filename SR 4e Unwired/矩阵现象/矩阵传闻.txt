> 好了，伙计们，自从超链者现象开始，全世界变得疯狂这一切以来已经有一段时间了。AI突然冒了出来，宣称在泛人类中占据了一席之地。企业和我们大多数人开始更仔细地审视矩阵，我们的世界。突然之间，系统异常看起来不再像异常了: 在比特和字节之间隐藏着什么“东西”。事实是，我们仍然不完全了解矩阵里到底发生了什么，但我们大多数人都看过他们称之为童话的东西。如今，童话故事有一个坏习惯，就是变成现实——而且其中不少是危险的。所以我认为是时候开始收集和交流关于那些令人毛骨悚然的事情的笔记并做好准备了。欢迎来到矩阵。欢迎来到未知的领域。

> FastJack

> 我将开始。四周前，我跟踪了几个节点的数据。当我进入一个相对无害的档案节点时，我遇到了某种……数字动物。我扫描了它的图标，一个巨大的蠕虫，但结果与我之前看到过的任何东西都不相符。它不具有我所期待的网精代码的对称或优雅，它当然也不是一个代理或化身。它似乎不喜欢我的行为，扫了我一眼。然后它突然消失了——我找不到任何痕迹，甚至是在我彻底搜索了档案节点的访问日志之后。

> 在接下来的几天里，我有一种奇怪的感觉，觉得有人在矩阵里跟踪我，但我认为这只是我平常的妄想。一周前，它在我毫无准备地情况下把我抓住了。虫子不知道从哪里冒出来并攻击了我。几秒钟之内，它就摧毁了我的化身，把我踢出了矩阵。这是我经历过的最沉重的一击，把我直接送到了我的街头医生那里。当我恢复过来，看了看我的通讯链后，我发现我的整个化身都被这个……东西消耗掉了。就好像, 吃掉。没有剩下足够的代码去做任何事情; 我不得不重新安装。这让我起了一身鸡皮疙瘩。

> 好故事。有人知道这个美丽的生物可能是什么吗?

> Netcat

> 我听说过一种AI可能符合这种描述。但我不知道……

> 显然，人们仍然相信超链者是怪物。这些想法太荒谬了。我们不能骇入任何人的大脑! 如果我们可以的话，有时候会很方便，但是…不。

> Netcat

> 我不再担心泛人类超链者了，但我好奇的是其他物种的超链者。还记得那些为海豚、半羊人、龙之类的东西制作数据插口的努力吗?在崩溃2.0之后，这些项目都神秘地消失了。你不得不认为它们中的一些是成功的。那我们有没有可能有非泛人类或诸如此类的超链者?

> Ecotope

> 拉斯维加斯有个萨斯科奇人表演者，艺名“小脚”，是街头魔幻综艺秀的成员之一。他表演了很多机灵的魔术，包括知道观众的非公开细节，以及一些用通讯链和其他设备进行的有趣的动作。当然，这一切都是幻觉，是对AR技术的巧妙运用，但他的一些剧目似乎非常类似于超链者所能做的事情。

> Cosmo

> Cerberus最近非常安静……

> Winterhawk

> 你想谈论超链者，让我们先谈谈一些企业仍在进行的可怕的实验。就在上周，环球全能科技不得不裁掉一家子公司，原因是一名内部人士揭发了这家子公司试图秘密制造超链者儿童。这个项目终止了但仍留下了几十个患有自闭症和智力障碍儿童。操。

> Netcat

> 我不知道为什么人们认为成为一个超链者是很强大的。我有个朋友，之前进行矩阵行动时他就有一个超链者同伴，一起去渗透某个原型公司节点。他们顺利通过了IC，但当他们进入节点时，这个超链者就开始踉踉跄跄，吓得魂飞魄散，好像喘不过气来。我的朋友一开始以为那个超链者被某种鬼鬼祟祟的IC击中了，但并没有警报，他也没扫描到任何异常的东西。出于某些原因，这个超链者太虚弱了，甚至不能自己下线——我的朋友最后回到了肉体空间，电击了那个家伙，把他打晕了。几个小时后，当那个超链者苏醒过来时，他说，走进那个节点就像从气闸中被推了出来，完全“没有共鸣”。我的朋友不得不回去自己完成了入侵，虽然防御很严格，但他说这次狂奔没有其他奇怪的地方。然而那个超链者拒绝回去。

> Mika

> 如果这是真的，那听起来是个非常非常可怕的地方。

> Netcat

> 那个调查中提到的其他传说是否属实? 还有人在线上被困住吗?

> Dr.Spin

> 在世界范围内，每年报告的案件不超过几起，其中大多数可以被解释为技术故障、药物滥用问题、精神错乱等。当然，这些是报道过的事件……

> Sunshine

> 我从一个在Helix的朋友那里听到一个有趣的故事。他多次在网上的各种社交场所遇到一个古怪而轻浮的女人。最终，他们发展成了一段虚拟恋情，但每次他试图让她敞开心扉，谈论她自己时，她就退缩了。她的行为也变得越来越奇怪，就好像她的主板少了几个电路。有一天他们大吵了一架，她气冲冲地走了。他的好奇心战胜了他自己，于是他开始挖掘信息。几周后，他找到了这个女人，却发现她是一个住院患者，已经昏迷了将近三年。这可把他吓坏了。他偶尔还是会看到她，但他会同她保持距离。

> Red Anya

> That wouldn’t be as weird as if he found out she was dead. I’ve been keeping an eye on these sorts of “ghosts in the Matrix” stories, and there’s been more than a few. Here, I’ll pop one up in another window. 
According to an inside source of mine, Lone Star had to shut down their own node before the intruder could inflict any significant damage. Before he went on his rampage, the man identified himself as Alex O’Keefe, a Novatech system administrator, and tried to report his own kidnapping. The desk officer didn’t take him seriously, both because Novatech no longer exists and because O’Keefe’s SIN pulled up a death certificate. The intruder apparently went berserk, screaming “I’m not dead!” and wreaking havoc in the node. The Star hasn’t seen him since. 
There was indeed an Alex O’Keefe who worked as a system administrator for Novatech. He died in the Matrix during Crash 2.0.

> Sunshine

> Come on, are you scared of people who use a fake ID and mess with the Star? It was probably just some Matrix gang prank.

> Slamm–0!

> It wouldn’t be the first time that the dead walked among us. In the virtual world, though, it’s hard to pinpoint the truth of such encounters. Just last week someone was banned from ShadowSea for claiming to have run into Captain Chaos in a DIMR node. 

>那不会比他发现她死了更奇怪。我一直在关注这类“矩阵里的鬼魂”的故事，而且不止几个。给，我在另一个窗口弹出一个。
根据我的内部消息，孤星必须在入侵者造成任何重大破坏之前关闭自己的节点。在行凶之前，这名男子称自己是诺瓦泰克公司的系统管理员亚历克斯·奥基夫(Alex O’keefe)，并试图报告自己被绑架。值班警官没有把他当回事，因为诺瓦泰克已经不存在了，也因为奥基夫的犯罪调查处拿出了死亡证明。闯入者显然是发疯了，大叫:“我还没死!”并在节点中造成严重破坏。从那以后，《星报》再也没见过他。
有个叫亚历克斯·奥基夫的人是诺瓦泰克公司的系统管理员。他在崩溃2.0中死于矩阵。

> Sunshine

>拜托，你害怕那些用假SIN惹是生非的人吗? 那可能只是矩阵帮派的恶作剧。

> Slamm-0 !

》 这也不是第一次死人出现在我们中间了。然而，在虚拟世界中，很难确定这种邂逅的真相。就在上周，有人因为声称在一个DIMR节点上遇到了混沌船长而被禁止进入暗影之海。

> Pistons

> 马上回来。我得去给一位老朋友扫墓。

> FastJack

> 不是所有的电子鬼故事都是坏的。几个月前，一个臭名昭著的自杀网站关闭了。(对于那些不了解Matrix社交生活中更令人沮丧的方面的人来说，自杀网站是那些打算自杀的人聚集在一起、寻找有效自杀方法的信息、相互刺激、订立自杀协议的节点。)运行节点的人被他们之前的几位访客吓了一跳——他们的死亡因为这个网站而登上了头条——死而复生地缠着那些还在围栏上的人。

> 巴卡Dabora

> 胡扯，又是恶作剧者，用一些愚蠢的死去的孩子的图标来吓唬一些有理智的人，让他们不必要地放弃自己的生命。对他们有利。

> Slamm-0 !

> 我不知道死人怎么想，但我知道一个应该死的人。不久之前，我在矩阵中发现了一些有趣的活动，并引起了我的注意，最终它将我引向了一群所谓的人工智能——Code Clan。这本身就够有趣的了，所以我继续挖掘，想知道更多关于它们的内容。我还没弄清楚他们的意图，就遇到了一个自称为“迪斯科迪亚”的超链者团伙，他们不知怎么地与“代码族”有关系，但却听命于一些冷酷无情的小贱人。这个新装备看起来更可疑，所以我转移了注意力，辨认出了他们的几个成员。但我发现情况不妙——两人之前都是Ex Pacis的成员。你自己算算。我会进一步调查的。

> Hannibelle

> Ex Pacis?

> Hannibelle

> Ex Pacis是一群…也许我能描述他们的最好方式是称他们为有毒超链者。他们那时候是御宅族，车祸之前。我不知道他们的目的是什么，但肯定不是什么好事。一些谣言暗示，他们与“冬夜”勾结，导致了崩盘。他们的领袖是Pax，一个曾为疯狂的AI Deus服务的反社会分子，如果这能让你知道他们的忠诚在哪的话。帕克斯，你觉得帕克斯是老大吗?

> OK, guys, it’s been some time since all that technomancer phenomena started and the world went mad. AIs popped out of nowhere and claimed their place in metahumanity. The corps and most of us began to take a closer look at the Matrix, our world. Suddenly system anomalies didn’t look like anomalies anymore: there were “things” hiding between the bits and bytes. The truth is that we still don’t completely know what’s really going on in the Matrix, but most of us have seen things they would call fairy tales. These days, fairy tales have a nasty habit of coming true—and more than a few are dangerous. So I think it’s time we started collecting and comparing notes on the creepy stuff out there and prepare. Welcome to the Matrix. Welcome to Terra Incognita.

> FastJack

> I’ll start. Four weeks ago I was following a data trail through several nodes. When I entered one—a relatively innocuous archival node—I met some kind of … digital animal. I scanned its icon, a giant worm, but the result didn’t fit anything I’ve seen before. It didn’t have the symmetry or elegance I’ve come to expect from sprite code, and it certainly wasn’t an agent or persona. It didn’t seem to like my actions and scanned me back. Then it suddenly disappeared—I couldn’t find any trace, even after I ransacked the archive’s access logs. 
For the next few days I had the strange feeling that somebody was following me through the Matrix, but I thought it was just my usual paranoia. Then a week ago, it caught me unprepared. The worm appeared out of nowhere and attacked me. In a matter of seconds it crashed my persona and kicked me off the Matrix. The dumpshock was the hardest kick I’d ever had and sent me directly to my streetdoc. After I recovered and took a look at my commlink, I found that my whole persona had been consumed by this … thing. As in, eaten. As in, there wasn’t enough code left to do anything with; I had to re-install. It gave me goosebumps.

> Glitch

> Nice story. Anybody got a clue what this beauty could have been? 

> Netcat

> I’ve heard of an AI species that could fit this description. But I don’t know … 

> Puck

> To go with this creepy cannibal story, I’ve found a nice Top 10 list of Matrix urban legends created by KSAF—it shows what the average slot thinks about the Matrix. 

> Sunshine

> What a crock. Joe Average really believes this shit?

> Slamm–0!

> Apparently people still believe that technomancers are monsters. These ideas are just ridiculous. We can’t hack anybody’s brain! It would be convenient if we could sometimes, but … no. 

> Netcat

> I’m not worried about metahuman technomancers any more, but what I am curious about is technomancers of other species. Remember all of those efforts to make datajacks for dolphins, satyrs, dragons, and whatnot? Those projects all went mysteriously silent after the Crash 2.0. You have to think some of them were successful. So is there a chance we have non-meta technomancers and the like out there? 

> Ecotope

> There’s a sasquatch performer in Vegas, stage name of Little Foot, part of a magical variety show on the Strip. He pulls a lot of clever magic tricks, including knowing non-public details of audience members, and some funny routines with animated commlinks and other devices. It’s all supposed to be illusion and clever use of AR, of course, but some of his material seems awfully similar to things a technomancer could do. 

> Cosmo

> Cerberus has been awfully quiet lately … 

> Winterhawk

> You want to talk about technomancers, let’s first talk about the horrible experiments some corps are still engaging in. Just last week Universal Omnitech had to cut loose a subsidiary after an insider blew the whistle on their secret attempts to genegineer technomancer children. They ended up with several dozen autistic and mentally handicapped children instead. Fuckers.

> Netcat

> I dunno why the people think being a technomancer is so great. I had a pal who was running a Matrix op with one, penetrating some sort of prototype corporate node. They skated through the IC no problem, but as soon as they were inside the node, the technomancer stumbled hard and started freaking out, like he was gasping for air. My pal thought the ‘mancer had been hit by some sort of sneaky IC at first, but there was no alert, and he wasn’t scanning anything unusual. For some reason, the technomancer was too weak to even log out on his own—my pal ended up popping back to meatspace and tasing the guy, to knock him out. When the technomancer came to, hours later, he said that walking into that node had been like getting pushed out an airlock, that it had been totally “devoid of Resonance.” My buddy had to go back and complete the hack himself, and while the defenses were tough, he said there was nothing else weird to the run. The technomancer refuses to go back though. 

> Mika

> If that’s true, that sounds like a horrible, horrible place. 

> Netcat

> Any truth to the other legends mentioned in the poll? Is anyone still getting trapped online? 

> Dr.Spin

> No more than a few reported cases a year, worldwide, and most of them can be explained away as technical glitches, substance abuse problems, mental derangements, etc. Of course, those are the reported incidents … 

> Sunshine

> I heard an interesting tale from a friend over on the Helix. It involved him repeatedly running into this strange and flighty woman on-line, at various social spots. Eventually it developed into a virtual fling, but everytime he tried to get her to open up and talk about herself, she backed off. Her behaviour kept growing odder and odder too, like her motherboard was missing a few circuits. They had a big row one day and she stormed off. His curiosity got the better of him, so he went digging. A few weeks later, he tracked the woman down—only to find out she was a hospital resident who had been in a coma for the better part of 3 years. That creeped him out big time. He still sees her on occasion, but he keeps his distance.

> Back in a bit. I have to look after an old friend’s grave. 

> FastJack

> Not all of these e-ghost stories are bad. A few months back, one of those notorious suicide sites shut itself down. (For those who don’t keep up on the more depressing aspects of Matrix social life, suicide sites are nodes where people contemplating suicide gather, find information about effective suicide methods, goad each other on, and make suicide pacts.) The people running the node were freaked out when several of their previous visitors—whose deaths had made headlines as a result of the site—returned from the dead to haunt those still on the fence.

> Baka Dabora

> Bollocks, just pranksters again, using the icons of some stupid, dead kids to try and scare some sense into people about to needlessly throw their lives away. Good for them. 

> Slamm–0!

> I don’t know about dead people, but I know about someone who should be dead. I ran across some … interesting activity in the Matrix that caught my attention not too long ago, and eventually it put me on the trail of a group of alleged AIs called the Code Clan. This was interesting enough in itself, so I kept digging to find out more about what they were about. I still hadn’t ascertained their agenda when I came across a technomancer gang calling itself the Discordians, who were somehow involved with this Code Clan, but who were taking orders from some seriously cold-hearted slitch. This new outfit seemed even shadier, so I switched focus, and ID’d a few of their members. What I found didn’t bode well—both had previously been members of Ex Pacis. You do the math. I’ll be looking into this more.

> Puck

> Ex Pacis? 

> Hannibelle

> Ex Pacis were a group of … perhaps the best way I can describe them would be to call them toxic technomancers. They were otaku back then, before the Crash. I don’t know what their agenda was, but it wasn’t good. Some rumors hint that they colluded with Winternight in bringing about the Crash. Their leader was Pax, a sociopath who had previously served the mad AI Deus, if that gives you a sense for where their loyalties lay. No one’s seen hide no hair of Pax since the Crash … Puck, do you think Pax is the leader? 

> The Smiling Bandit

> Puck’s been offline for 5 days straight—and he’s never offline. I’m worried.
