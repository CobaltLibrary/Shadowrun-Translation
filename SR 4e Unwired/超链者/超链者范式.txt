[size=12pt][b]范式——虚拟的神明与魔鬼[/b][/size]

虽然一直有UMP(未知矩阵现象)的极客们在兴趣小组中报道和推测的关于矩阵的传闻，关于虚拟生物和实体的都市怪谈，但AI和网精的公开披露的公开曝光让所有这些目击者的描述有了一个新的视角。然而，没有人对这些似乎来自于矩阵正常范围之外的实体提出一个令人满意的解释，超链者已经被报道或追随或感受到了内在的联系。

这些被称为范式的存在缺乏一个更好的分类，因为他们是真正的“无与伦比的例子”的矩阵存在，似乎既不是网精，电子幽灵，也不是AI，他们似乎诞生于矩阵或共鸣领域，超出了常规矩阵的脉冲和字节层面。

一些人推测，在崩溃2.0之后，新兴超链者的集体潜意识中自发形成了范式，他们需要洞察自己的新能力或渴望一种精神信仰。然而，事实是，没有人真正知道这些生物从哪里来，甚至他们是否真的存在。就像法师们没能找到一个可靠的解释来解释他们的精魂导师的起源一样，在觉醒近60年后，范式似乎无法轻易解释。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]PARAGONS—VIRTUAL GODS AND DEMONS[/b][/size] 
While there have always been rumors of sightings in the Matrix, urban myths of virtual beings and entities, reported and speculated about in SIGs by UMP (Unidentified Matrix Phenomenon) geeks, the public revelation of AI and sprites put all of these eyewitness accounts in a new perspective. And yet … no one has come up with a satisfying explanation about these entities that seem to originate from beyond the normal realms of the Matrix and that technomancers have been reported to follow or feel inherently connected to. 
Named paragons—due to the lack of a better categorization and because they are truly “peerless examples” of Matrix beings that seem to be neither sprite, e-ghost, nor AI—they appear to be native to the Matrix or to resonance realms, layers of pulses and bytes beyond the normal Matrix.
Some speculate that paragons formed spontaneously and recently, in the wake of Crash 2.0, from the collective subconscious minds of Emerging technomancers who were in need of insight into their new abilities or yearning for a spiritual belief. The truth is, however, that nobody really knows where these beings come from, or even if they really exist. Just as magicians have failed to come up with a reliable explanation of the origin of their mentor spirits, nearly 60 years after the Awakening, paragons seem to defy an easy explanation.
[/spoiler]

[b]交流[/b]

即使是超链者也在他们对范式的看法和信仰上存在分歧。有些人认为它们是网络世界的神(或魔鬼)，是由代码和人类的进化创造出来的，而另一些人则认为它们是一个想法、一个形象或一个原型的具体化投影，反映了虚拟世界和居住在其中的人的本质。另一些人认为，它们实际上是拥有智慧的共鸣程序，不像泛人类迄今编写的任何程序(包括AI)。虽然这些化身乍一看像是精魂导师，但范式的内在是不同的，体现了现代、技术和代码世界的方面，而不是精神领域。

除了这些不同的解释，遵循一定的模式与一个范式的互动，被称为交流。超链者曾报告说，在在线冥想过程中，他们突然被传送到一个不同于任何虚拟或物理体验的地方。在那里，他们遇到了一个他们觉得与之有内在联系的存在，这个存在赋予了他们对矩阵及其数字机制更深入的了解。

[spoiler]
[b]COMMUNION[/b] 
Even technomancers are divided in their view of and belief in paragons. While some see them as gods (or demons) of the cyberworld, created by the evolution of the code and humanity, others view them as embodied projections of an idea, an image, or an archetype, something that reflects the nature of the virtual world and those who reside in it. Others believe that they are actually sapient Resonance programs, unlike anything that metahumanity has programmed so far (including AIs). Although these incarnations seem to resemble mentor spirits on first glance, paragons are inherently different and embody aspects of the modern, technological, and coded world rather than spiritual realms. 
Regardless of these differing explanations, interaction with a paragon, called communion, follows certain patterns. Technomancers have reported being suddenly transported to a place, unlike any in their virtual or physical experience, during meditative online sessions. There, they encountered a being to which they felt inherently linked that gifted them with deeper insight into the Matrix and its digital mechanisms.
[/spoiler]

[b]范式修正[/b]

一个范式可以被超链者角色作为超链者范式特质(第37页)。在游戏中，对一个范式的忠诚会改变超链者的行为，并以积极和消极的方式影响她操纵共鸣的方式(通过某些优势和劣势反映出来)。超链者在调整共鸣(通过使用复合程式、技能、线程或编制)时，根据范式的影响范围获得奖励骰。另一方面，超链者可能会在范式的影响范围外减少骰池或受阻。这些加值和惩罚在所有方面都被视为类似精魂导师的修正。

[spoiler]
[b]PARAGON MODIFIERS[/b] 
A paragon can be taken by a technomancer character with the Paragon quality (p. 37). In game terms, allegiance to a paragon alters a technomancer’s behavior and affects how she manipulates Resonance in both positive and negative ways—reflected by certain advantages and disadvantages. A technomancer gains bonus dice when modulating Resonance (through the use of complex forms, skills, threading, or the use of Compiling) in accordance with the paragon’s area of influence. On the other hand, the technomancer may lose dice or become otherwise hampered outside the paragon’s sphere. These bonuses and penalties are in all regards treated like mentor spirit modifiers (p. 192, SR4).

[b]范式[/b]

费用:5BP(Build Points 构建点数)

这个特质只适用于那些拥有超链者特质的角色。这个角色已经与一个神秘而强大的矩阵实体取得了联系，它作为一个向导并赋予某些优势和劣势，参见《超链者范式》，第149页。一个角色只能有一个范式。

[spoiler]
[b]PARAGON[/b] 
Cost: 5 BP 
This quality is available only to those with the Technomancer quality. The character has made contact with a mysterious and powerful Matrix entity, which acts as a guide and grants certain advantages and disadvantages, see Paragons, p. 149. A character may only have one Paragon.

[b]扮演范式[/b]

类似于精魂导师(SR4页，第192页)，范式应该被GM用作交流信息和加强角色扮演的工具。然而，范式因他们与数字世界的联系而应该被描绘成不同于精魂导师的形象。范式还没有与泛人类建立长期的联系，他们来自数字领域。因此，他们的行为和本性应该是非人类的，抽象的，陌生的，比泛人类的“碳基”生命形式或精神更少激情。

[spoiler]
[b]ROLEPLAYING PARAGONS[/b] 
Similar to mentor spirits (p. 192, SR4), paragons should be used by the gamemaster as tool to communicate information and enhance roleplaying. However, paragons should be portrayed differently from mentor spirits, due to their connection to the digital world. Paragons haven’t yet established a long-term connection to metahumanity and originate from a computerized realm. Thus, their behavior and nature should be non-human, abstract, alien, and less passionate than metahuman “carbon-based” life forms or spirits.

[size=12pt][b]范式样例[/b][/size]

每个范式代表着不同的、通常是非人类的人物角色所崇拜的某种原型。由于矩阵的无所不在，这些概念大多是全球性的，范式通常更统一，较少受文化或传统差异的影响，不像精魂导师。下面的例子仅仅是存在的不同概念的例子，远远不是一个完整的列表。玩家可以与GM合作，创造出最适合自己角色外貌的完美形象。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]SAMPLE PARAGONS[/b][/size] 
Each paragon represents some kind of archetype idolized in different, often non-humanoid, personas. Since most of these concepts are global due to the omnipresence of the Matrix, paragons are often more uniform and are less subject to cultural or traditional differences, unlike mentor spirits. The paragons below serve merely as examples of different concepts that exist and are far from a complete list. Players can always work with their gamemaster to develop a paragon profile that fits their character’s outlook best.

[quote]
[b]01[/b]

01是开始和结束，是阿尔法和欧米加。有些人称之为“深度共鸣”(Deep Resonance)，因为找不到更好的描述，它是无处不在的虚拟世界意识，是虚拟和谐的体现，是代码的精髓。01的追随者往往会从它那里寻求指导和灵感。

优点:编制和注册任何类型的网精+1DP

缺点:01是完美的代码，并要求他的追随者也如此，或者至少在他们失败时给他们一个严厉的教训。追随01的超链者必须花费2点极限点来消除失误或降低严重失误。

[spoiler]
[b]01[/b] 

Zero-One is the beginning and the end, the alpha and the omega. While some call it the Deep Resonance, for lack of a better word, it is the consciousness of the virtual world that permeates everything, the embodiment of virtual harmony, the essence of the code. Followers of Zero-One tend to seek it for guidance and inspiration. 

Advantages: +1 die for compiling and registering sprites of any type 

Disadvantages: Zero-One is the perfection of the code and demands the same from his followers, or at least teaches them a harsh lesson if they fail. Zero-One technomancers must spend 2 points of Edge to negate a glitch or downgrade a critical glitch.

[quote]
[b]化名[/b]

化名是矩阵的间谍，是不断变化的黑客角色或匿名用户的化身。化名是关于交换或改变访问id、代码和位置的一切，无论是在矩阵中还是在现实生活中。化名没有外貌。他变得与其他矩阵用户难以区分，通过窃取其他用户的代码来欺骗和冒充其他用户。

优点:欺骗检定+2DP，破解或侦探网精+1DP(玩家必须选择一个)

缺点:追随化名的超链者无法忍受支付他们的生活方式，因此必须利用他们的能力来欺骗他们的生活方式(黑客手册，第80页)。

[spoiler]
[b]ALIAS[/b] 

Alias is the spy of the Matrix, the embodiment of the changing hacker persona or anonymous user. Alias is all about switching or exchanging access IDs, codes, and places, both in the Matrix and real life. Alias has no face. He becomes indistinguishable from other Matrix users, fooling and impersonating other users by stealing their codes. 

Advantages: +2 dice to Spoof Tests, +1 die for Crack or Sleuth sprites (player must choose one) 

Disadvantage: Alias technomancers cannot abide to pay for their lifestyle and must therefore use their abilities to spoof their lifestyle (Hacker’s Handbook, p. 80).

[quote]
[b]黑帽子[/b]

黑帽子是黑客的化身，他们利用计算机系统是出于某种自私的动机。虽然有些人只是为了个人利益和金钱利益而盗取和出售数据的数据窃贼，但也有一些人只是出于兴趣、好奇或在黑客社区中的个人声誉而入侵节点。

优势:利用漏洞检定+2DP，破解或诱错网精(玩家必须选择一个)+1DP

缺点:追随黑帽子的超链者很难控制自己入侵一个有趣的节点。超链者必须在意志力+魅力(3)检定中获得成功，才能在有机会时避免黑进这样的系统。

[spoiler]
[b]THE BLACK HAT[/b] 

The Black Hat is the personified essence of the hacker, who works to exploit computer systems out of a certain self-serving motivation.

优势:所有加密和解密检定+2DP，情报或数据网精(玩家必须选择一个)+1DP

缺点:追随守密人的超链者不会轻易泄露机密，也不会向不可靠的来源泄露。超链者必须做一个意志力+逻辑(3)检定来与他不完全信任的人分享秘密或重要信息，这种信任是很罕见的。

[spoiler]
[b]CRYPTOME[/b] 

Cryptome is the keeper of secrets. He is the preserver of hidden data and a master of encryption, protecting paydata stashed away in vaults, riddled with massive layers of protection. Knowing all confidential and classified information, he is the embodiment of cryptograms and cipher keys used to encrypt and decrypt data. 

Advantage: +2 dice to all Encryption and Decryption Tests, +1 die for Courier or Data sprites (player must choose one) 

Disadvantage: Technomancers who follow Cryptome don’t surrender secrets easily and never to unreliable sources. The technomancer must make a Willpower + Logic (3) Test to share a secret or important information with someone he does not completely trust … and such trust is rare.

[b]代达罗斯[/b]

代达罗斯以希腊著名发明家的名字命名，他是机器修补匠、设备和(有时是危险的)技术发明的化身。代达罗斯是建造者和创新者的化身，热爱机器人、无人机、交通工具和电子设备的超链者对这一范式特别感兴趣。

优势:硬件检定+2DP，机械或诱错网精(玩家必须选择一个)+1DP

缺点:追随代达罗斯的超链者倾向于以一种比平常更下意识的方式与他们工作的机器进行交互。因此，他们所做的修改是针对与他们有天赋和世界观的人的，而不是针对普通用户或非代达罗斯超链者的直觉。由这些超链者建造或修改的设备有一个更神秘的用户界面，强加给任何想要合法使用它的人一个-2dp的修正。

[spoiler]
[b]DAEDALUS[/b] 

Named after the famous Greek inventor, Daedalus is the embodiment of the machine tinkerer, the master of devices and (sometimes dangerous) technical inventions. As Daedalus is the personification of the constructor and innovator, technomancers with a love of robotic machines, drones, vehicles, and electronic devices feel especially drawn to this paragon. 

Advantage: +2 dice to Hardware Tests, +1 die for Machine or Fault sprites (player must choose one) 

Disadvantage: Technomancers who follow Daedalus tend to interact with the machines on which they are working in an even more subconscious manner than usual. As a result, modifications they make are geared towards someone with their talents and worldview, rather than something that is intuitive to a mundane user or even a non-Daedalus technomancer. Devices built or modified by such technomancers have a more arcane user interface, imposing a –2 modifier on anyone who wants to legitimately use it.

优势:线程检定+2DP，编码或数据网精(玩家必须选择一个)+1DP

缺点:矩阵战斗攻击检定-1DP

[spoiler]
[b]FLOW[/b]

The Flow represents the constant stream of data through computer networks. Like a river, data constantly moves from one point to another in the Matrix, forming tides, pools of information, or even virtual oceans. Flow is constantly moving, traveling from source to destination. Technomancers who follow the Flow understand the nature of the data stream more deeply and are able to see the currents of the Matrix more clearly.
