[color=brown][size=16pt][b]与矩阵相调谐——深潜[/b][/size][/color]

虽然与觉醒相比，浮现现象尚未成熟，但超链者们近年来已经展现出了快速的发展，在个人与矩阵和共鸣的协调方面取得了新的突破。得益于那些愿意分享他们关于深潜“模式”的知识的前宅客，今天的超链者正在以虚拟的速度开辟自己的道路。

[color=brown][size=16pt][b]IN TUNE WITH THE MATRIX——SUBMERSION[/b][/size][/color]

While the phenomenon of Emergence is still young compared to the Awakening, technomancers have displayed fast development in recent years, breaking new ground toward personal attunement with the Matrix and the Resonance. Profiting from former otaku who were willing to share their knowledge about "modes" of submersion, technomancers today are blazing their own paths at virtual speeds.

[size=14pt][b]潜入水底[/b][/size]

深潜是一种非常个人化和令人痛苦的体验，它是一个成长和认识的过程，迫使超链者与她的恐惧、狭隘和自身缺点作斗争，要求她打开心扉，对她自己和矩阵获得更深层次的了解。

由于实际过程需要超链者将她的活体化身浸入数字世界的深处，一些人将深潜称为在虚拟海洋中“潜入水底”。通过与代码融为一体，超链者允许共鸣渗入她的数字本质，这使她能够看到图像塑模的背后，从根本上理解矩阵的本质。这种直观的领悟使她能够使用更强大的能力，即回声，也使她能够使用“后门”进入矩阵底层的共鸣域(172页)。

为了遵循这条改进之路，超链者角色必须支付相应级别的业力成本，并需要花一些时间通过与虚拟世界的互动来探索其能力。

GM应该仔细考虑超链者是否已经获得足够的洞察力来执行进一步的深潜。它不应该被视为获得新回声的一种快速方法，这可以通过使用浮现回声的可选规则(第145页)更容易获得。

有关深潜和回声的基本规则可在SR4第238页上找到。以下规则旨在为深潜过程提供额外的选项和理解。

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]TAKING A DIVE[/b][/size]

A very personal and ego-wrenching experience, submersion is a process of growth and awareness that forces a technomancer to grapple with her fears, small-mindedness, and shortcomings, opening her mind and developing a deeper understanding of herself and the Matrix.

Since the actual process requires the technomancer to submerge her living persona into the depths of the digital world, some have referred to submersion as “taking a dive” in the virtual sea. By becoming one with the code, the technomancer allows Resonance to seep through her digital essence, which enables her to see behind sculpted iconography and to understand the Matrix on a fundamental level. This intuitive realization grants her access to greater abilities known as echoes, and also enables her to use "backdoors" into the Resonance Realms (p. 172) underlying the Matrix. 

To follow this path of improvement, technomancer characters must pay the Karma cost of the appropriate grade of submersion and should have spent some time exploring its abilities by interacting with the virtual world.

Gamemasters should carefully consider if a technomancer has gained enough insight to perform a further submersion. It should not be viewed as a fast way to gain new echoes, which can be acquired more easily by using the Optional Rule to Emerge Echoes (p. 145).

The basic rules concerning submersion and echoes can be found on p. 238, SR4. The following rules are intended to provide additional options and depth to the process of submersion.

[size=12pt][b]网络深潜[/b][/size]

虽然角色可以很容易地自行深潜(第238页，SR4页)，但她也可以作为一个共鸣网络的一部分这样做。出于对矩阵和链接彼此的共鸣的共同兴趣和理解，有着相同兴趣的深潜超链者经常会进行虚拟的连接。虽然一些临时网络(昵称为集会)的存在只是为了共享知识或共同的深潜过程，但大多数网络(昵称为公会)是稳定和长期的协会，为分享和交换信息与知识提供了基础，即使这些公会仅在虚拟世界存在。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]NETWORK SUBMERSION[/b][/size]

While a character can easily submerge on her own (p. 238, SR4), she may also do so as part of a resonance network (Resonance Networks, p. 142). Submerged technomancers with like-minded interests often connect virtually, out of mutual interest and understanding of the Matrix and the Resonance that links them. While some temporary networks (called parties) exist just for the joint process of submersion or sharing of knowledge, most networks (nicknamed guilds) are stable and long-term associations that provide a basis to share and exchange information and knowledge, even if these guilds only exist virtually.
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]虚拟穿越[/b][/size]

深潜是旨在加深对矩阵理解的无限虚拟之旅的一个断点。这是一种通过暴露于未经过滤的纯净共鸣而诱发的超现实体验，通过这种体验，超链者超越了他自己，达到了一个通向“数字进化”和精神启示的新的进化等级。这个过程，通常被称为”重编码”，使得超链者能够进入矩阵的更深层次来获得回声。

由于深潜是个人准则揭示和自我转变的一部分，它是一个私密的过程，受角色自身观点和理念的影响。GM和玩家在制定自己的“穿越仪式”时，应该考虑到角色对矩阵的看法，这些看法反映在他所选择的支流(第136页)或范式(第149页)中。一位技术萨满可以前往他觉得与之有联系的虚拟景观和节点朝圣；一位机械驭手可能需要从载具或无人机的“跳入”视角开始；一位源码术士可以精心准备，用一种类似大门的仪式来打开后门；一位信息先知则会对着某段代码沉思。仪式的差别很大，取决于特定支流的理念和与矩阵不同方面的调谐。

除了经历深潜任务所需的基本时间和精力外(见下文)，GM可以自由调整所花费的时间和涉及的深潜事件，以适应角色和她的战役风格。由于共鸣网络空间超越了时间的感知，角色甚至可以在深潜期间体验整个虚拟人生。

如果玩家愿意，深潜可以包括深潜任务(第141页)。这些任务是对角色意志和能力的特定挑战，角色为了证明自己值得深潜而自愿接受。

超链者的范式(如果他追随一个的话)也可能在深潜过程、准备任务或两者中都起到重要作用，不过具体什么作用应该根据特定角色和他选择的穿越仪式或深潜任务的性质来决定。

虽然小组游戏风格可能决定了他们投入多少注意力于深潜过程，但它提供了一个独特的角色扮演和故事的机会，这一点应该加以强调。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]VIRTUAL CROSSING[/b][/size]

Submersion is a breakpoint on an indefinite virtual journey toward a deeper understanding of the Matrix. It is a hyper-real experience, induced by unfiltered exposure to pure Resonance, by which the technomancer transcends himself to gain a new level of advancement, leading to a “digital evolution“ and a spiritual revelation. This process, often referred to as ”recoding,” enables technomancers to gain access to the deeper layers of the Matrix to spawn echoes.

Since submersion is part of the individual’s unveiling of the code and personal transformation, it is an intimate process that is influenced by the character’s own views and beliefs. The character’s perception of the Matrix, reflected by his chosen stream (p. 136) or paragon (p. 149), should be taken into account by gamemasters and players developing their own “rite of crossing.“ A technoshaman might go on a pilgrimage to virtual landscapes and nodes he feels connected with; a dronomancer might need to start from a ”jumped-in” view of a vehicle or drone; a sourceror might prepare meticulously to open a back door with a gate-like ritual; or an info savant might dowse over a pile of code. Rites vary enormously, depending on stream-specific beliefs and attunements to different aspects of the Matrix.

Except for the basic time and effort required to undergo submersion tasks (see below), the gamemaster is free to adjust the time spent and the submersion event involved to suit the character and the flavor of her campaign. As the Resonance cyberspace is beyond the sense of time, characters could even experience a whole virtual life during a submersion.

If the player desires, the submersion may include a submersion task (p. 141). These tasks are specific challenges of will and ability to which the character willingly submits in order to prove himself worthy of submersion.

The paragon of a technomancer, should he follow one, may also play an important part during the submersion session, the preparing task, or both, though exactly what that role is should be tailored to the particular character and the nature of the crossing rite or submersion task he chooses.

While the group’s style of gaming may determine how much attention is devoted to submersion sessions, it provides a unique roleplaying and story opportunity that should be emphasized.

[size=14pt][b]深潜任务[/b][/size]

想要进行深潜的角色可以准备一项通过挑战他们的注意力和能力来“调谐”他们的任务。这可以是对一个高级安保节点的即时入侵，针对一个混乱编码的矩阵战斗，或者创建一段新的代码。

完成一项深潜任务可以减少20%的正常深潜业力成本(向上取整)。每次深潜只能完成一项任务。角色必须在深潜之前选择任务(或者任务必须在深潜会话开始前24小时进行)。除了伟大骇入(第142页)之外，超链者不能“保存”任务。如果角色完成了任务，他就能够以较低的成本进行深潜。如果他失败了，他可以重新尝试(不会失去业力奖励)直到成功，或者支付深潜的全部费用。

由于深潜是一个相当新的现象，到目前为止，超链者社区只发现了少数任务，但随着超链者继续追求数字化提升的方式，更多的任务被认为会在未来出现。

下面的深潜任务是超链者普遍了解的例子。我们鼓励玩家和GM设计新的深潜任务，以适应他们的故事和超链者的议程。

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]SUBMERSION TASKS[/b][/size]

Characters who want to perform a submersion may prepare for it with a task that "tunes" them by challenging their focus and ability. This can be an intrusion in a highly secured node on the fly, cybercombat against a coded mayhem, or creating a new piece of code.

Undergoing a task for submersion reduces the normal Karma cost of submersion by 20 percent (rounded up). Only one task is possible per submersion. The character must choose the task before undergoing submersion (or the task must take place 24 hours before the submersion session starts). The technomancer cannot “save up” tasks except for the great hack (p. 142). If the character passes the task he is able to undergo submersion with reduced costs. It he fails, he can either retry (without losing karma) until he succeeds, or pay the full price for the submersion.

Since submersion is a fairly new phenomenon, only a few tasks have so far been discovered by the techomancer community, though more are suspected to show up in the future as technomancers continue pursuing the ways toward digital ascension.

The following submersion tasks are examples commonly known to technomancers. Players and gamemasters are encouraged to design new submersion tasks to fit their story and the technomancer’s agenda.
[/spoiler]

[quote]
[size=12pt][b]摘除[/b][/size]

作为一种虚拟的牺牲，摘除是对超链者化身的故意残害，由于超链者神经结构的反馈，这也会对他的真实身体造成削弱效果。一名超链者会在这个任务中牺牲他活体化身的一部分(比如它的分辨率，它的物理外观，甚至它的一个肢体)。虽然这种“损伤”不会在虚拟层面损害他，但在现实中，被牺牲或被损害的部分会在神经结构上受损。在摘除过程中被切断的手臂会变得麻木和麻痹。身体的某些部位会由于对化身的认知去除而变得麻木。虽然超链者不会因为这个过程而失去属性点，但它应该在某种程度上损害他。残障的确切状况和物理检定中可能出现的负面骰池修正值由GM决定，但应该反映出至少相当于价值10BP的负面特质影响并且不能被买除。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]EVISCERATION[/b][/size]

A virtual sacrifice of some kind, evisceration is a deliberate mutilation of the technomancer’s persona that also causes debilitating effects on his real body due to feedback in the technomancer’s neurological structure. A technomancer may call on this submersion task and virtually sacrifice a part of his living persona (such as its resolution, its physical appearance, or even one of its limbs). While this "damage" will not impair him on the virtual level, the sacrificed or damaged part becomes neurologically impaired in reality. An arm that was virtually cut off in the process of evisceration becomes numb and paralyzed. Certain areas of the body may turn numb as a result of de-rezzing a persona. While the technomancer does not lose attribute points as a result of the process, it should impair him in one way or another. The exact nature of the handicap and possible negative dice pool modifier for physical tests is left to the gamemaster, but should reflect a negative quality worth at least 10 BP that cannot be bought off.
[/spoiler]
[/quote]

[quote]
[size=12pt][b]伟大骇入[/b][/size]

伟大骇入任务要求角色展示一场即时的高难度骇入以向黑客或超链者社区展示她的技能。在进行伟大骇入之前，GM和玩家应该商定一个适当的目标，并通过角色扮演来引入它。这样的任务可以发展成独立的狂奔(例如，一个不能从外部访问的孤立节点，必须从内部骇入)，尽管这场狂奔必须与个人相关并适合于承担它的角色。

作为一般的指导方针，狂奔的业力奖励应该与角色寻求的深潜阶层的业力成本相当。如果GM认可整场狂奔或其中的一部分是一个伟大骇入，成功完成狂奔的目标意味着任务的第一部分已经完成。

伟大骇入的第二部分是通过在公共网站或黑客网站上传骇入过程中获得的数据，包括一些与角色有关的标签或标志，来提高角色的知名度，以“进行炫耀”。然而，这也是角色犯罪的证据……执法部门可能会注意到这一点！

政府机关的节点、企业的研发中心枢纽、公众人士或名人的私人节点或银行账户等安全系数较高的节点是伟大骇入的常见目标。

基于GM的判断，角色可以在准备深潜进入另一个等级之前进行一次伟大骇入，本质上是“保存”伟大骇入并将其作为下一次深潜任务。一次伟大骇入必须被用于角色的下一次深潜，并且不能被保存超过当前深潜阶层。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]GREAT HACK[/b][/size]

A great hack task requires a character to perform a difficult onthe-fly hack to show her skills to the hacker or technomancer online community. Before committing the great hack, the gamemaster and player should agree on an appropriate target and introduce it through roleplaying. Such a task may develop into a run in its own right (for instance, an isolated node that cannot be accessed from the outside and must be hacked from the inside), though the run must be personally relevant and appropriate to the character undertaking it.

As a general guideline, the Karma award for the run should be comparable to the Karma cost of the grade the character seeks. If the gamemaster approves the run or part thereof as a great hack, successfully accomplishing the goal of the run means the first part of the task is accomplished.

The second part of a great hack is to boost its fame by uploading data acquired during the hack on a public or hacker site, including some sort of tag or logo that refers to the character, to “show off.” This is, however, evidence that the character committed the crime … law enforcement is likely to take notice!

Nodes of governmental agencies, R&D nexi of corporations, bank accounts or private nodes of public or famous figures, as well as other highly secured nodes are common targets for great hacks.

At the gamemaster’s discretion, a character may carry out a great hack before she is ready to submerge to another grade, essentially "saving" the hack and using it as a task for her next submersion. A great hack must be used for the character’s next submersion, however, and cannot be saved beyond that grade.

[quote]
[size=12pt][b]重组[/b][/size]

如果超链者在重组过程中协助了一个熵网精(第158页)，牺牲他的一个注册网精并参与网精的编码仪式则可以被用作一项深潜任务。为了从这种精神时刻中获利，角色必须在直觉+共鸣(2)检定和意志力+逻辑(2)检定中获得成功。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]REASSEMBLING[/b][/size]

If a technomancer assists an entropic sprite in a reassembling process (p. 158), sacrificing one of his registered sprites and participating in the ritual recoding of the sprite can be used as a submersion task. In order to profit from such a spiritual moment, the character must succeed in an Intuition + Resonance (2) Test and a Willpower + Logic (2) Test.
[/spoiler]
[/quote]

[quote]
[size=12pt][b]共鸣域搜寻[/b][/size]

要完成此任务，超链者必须访问共鸣域上的特定位置，这通常称为共鸣室或实例。只有曾经经历过深潜的角色才能找到隐藏在矩阵中的进入共鸣域的后门。

在进入共鸣域之前，超链者必须找到一个进入的后门，这需要进行一个共鸣+抵抗衰褪属性+深潜阶层(12，1小时)的延续检定。短暂中断准备过程不会受到惩罚，但这个过程要求很高，除了最普通的任务外没有时间进行任何活动。

GM应该根据超链者的支流和理念来定制搜寻过程，不仅要挑战他的骇入技能，还要让搜寻成为一种激烈而巨大的体验，以考验超链者人格的各个方面。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]RESONANCE REALM SEARCH[/b][/size]

To undergo this task, the technomancer must access a specific location on a resonance realm, often referred to as a resonance room or instance. Only characters who have undergone submersion before can locate backdoors into the resonance realm (Resonance Realms, p. 172) hidden in the Matrix.

Before accessing the resonance realm, the technomancer must get access via the backdoor, requiring a Resonance + Fading attribute + submersion grade (12, 1 hour) Extended Test. There is no penalty for briefly interrupting the preparation process, but the process is demanding and leaves no time for any activities other than the most ordinary tasks.

The gamemaster should tailor the search to fit the technomancer’s stream and beliefs, not only challenging his hacking skills but making it a drastic and tremendous experience that tests every aspect of the technomancer’s personality.
[/spoiler]
[/quote]

[quote]
[size=12pt][b]源代码[/b][/size]

这项任务要求超链者编写一份代表她对矩阵模式的洞察和理解的源代码杰作。这段源代码必须是正常的数字数据格式，可以存储在外部存储设备中，但它携带有超链者的共鸣签名，类似于数据网精创建的共鸣水印标记。

为了塑造这个源代码，超链者必须执行逻辑+软件(8+所需的深潜阶层，1周)延续检定。就其本质而言，这份源代码给作者留下了一个数据踪迹，超链者应当仔细考虑这样的创造。如果在网上使用，源代码可以被网精或超链者用作共鸣链接，以数字方式在矩阵中追踪其创造者。出于这个原因，超链者通常不愿意发布他们的源代码或保留多个副本。

然而，如果源代码的所有版本都以某种方式被删除了，那么程序员就会因如此重大的损失而遭受信任危机，必须将其深潜阶层降低1层。这就是为什么超链者通常会在一个安全的数据仓库中保存至少一份拷贝。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]SOURCE CODE[/b][/size]

This task requires the technomancer to program a masterpiece of source code that represents the sum of her insight and understanding of the patterns of the Matrix. The piece of source code must be in a normal digital data format that can be stored in an external storage device, but which carries the resonance signature of the technomancer, similar to a resonance watermark created by a data sprite.

To shape this source code, the technomancer must perform a Logic + Software (8 + desired submersion grade, 1 week) Extended Test. By its very nature, this source code leaves a datatrail to the author, and technomancers should carefully consider such creations. If used online, the source code can be employed by a sprite or technomancer as a resonance link to track its owner digitally in the Matrix. For this reason, technomancers are typically reluctant to distribute their source code or keep multiple copies around.

However, if all versions of a source code are somehow deleted, the programmer will suffer a crisis of faith at such a momentous loss and must reduce her submersion grade by 1. This is why technomancers usually keep at least one copy in a secure data store.

[size=14pt][b]超链者网络[/b][/size]

通过无所不在的矩阵和随处可见的通讯链，由志同道合者组成的社交网络成为70年代全球社会的一个重要组成部分。以矩阵为媒介的新社会环境每天都在形成，消失，在一周后又再次崛起。随着无线矩阵的引入，人们对在线圈子、论坛、聊天室或门户的参与急剧增加。超链者从这种连接中取得了巨大的优势，因为全球各地的超链者都能够借此与可能永远没有机会见面的人取得联系。

随着2070年超链者的正式“登场“，人们对他们的能力变得更加”了解”。尽管遭到了其他网络用户的排斥和偏见，以及企业和猎头所采取的防范措施，但那些想要分享知识、教导他人或从其他经验丰富的超链者那里寻求启发的超链者正在利用矩阵——他们的自然环境——作为彼此交流的媒介。

超链者网络是一种虚拟的社交平台，超链者可以通过专门的网站、兴趣小组、聊天板，有时甚至是面对面的会议进行互动。虽然这些网站不需要严格地与超链者相关, 也可以专注于其他主题(交易、俱乐部、枪)或具有大量正常(非超链者)成员的特征数据库，但它们总有一个特殊的成员区, 通常由只有超链者和其他共鸣实体可以看到的共鸣签名或共鸣链接来进行标记，在那里，超链者可以在没有黑客和公司下属窥探的情况下私密交流。这个会员专区是真正的共鸣网络的交汇处。

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]TECHNOMANCER NETWORKS[/b][/size]

With the omnipresence of the Matrix and the high frequency of commlinks, social networking of like-minded people has become an important factor in the global society in the ’70s. New Matrix-mediated social environments form every day, disappear, and rise again a week later. The participation of people in online circles, forums, chats, or folksonomy has drastically increased with the introduction of the wireless Matrix. Technomancers draw a huge advantage from this connectivity, which allows technomancers from anywhere on the globe to get in contact who probably would never have the chance to meet in person.

With the official “coming out“ of technomancers in 2070, people have been more ”free-giving” with their abilities. Despite rejection and prejudice by other online users and precautions taken by corporations and head-hunters, technomancers who want to share knowledge, teach others, or seek enlightenment from experienced technomancers are using the Matrix—their natural environment—as a medium to communicate with each other.

Technomancer networks are virtual social platforms on which technomancers can interact via dedicated sites, SIGs, chatboards, and sometimes even eye-to-eye meetings. While these sites don’t have to be strictly technomancer-related and can focus on any other topic (trid, clubs, guns) or feature databases with a great number of normal (non-technomancer) members, they always have a special members area, often marked by a resonance signature or link that only technomancers and resonance beings can see, where technomancers can communicate in privacy without hackers and corporate henchmen snooping around. This members-only area is where the true resonance network meets.
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]集会和公会[/b][/size]

一般来说，有两种不同类型的共鸣网络：集会和公会。

没有固定成员的临时网络被称为集会。参与者的数量和特定的个人可能每次集会都有所不同。它们通常是出于参与者的共同利益而临时形成的(例如，由于深潜、共享的深潜任务或回声学习的过程)，而且往往是自发成立的。其成员不一定有任何相似的观点或社会约束。集会的举办信息通常在一个只有超链者才能找到的专门网站上，距离集会实际举行前很短的时间内公布。

公会是类似于魔法组织的稳定协会。尽管公会成员仅在网上见面，可能生活在不同的大陆，并且可能从未见过对方，但他们感到彼此联系，这不仅是因为他们的能力，还因为他们拥有相似的目标或理念。公会是超链者社区的中心，允许超链者分享经验和资源、练习共鸣能力并寻求指导。

虽然所有公会都主要致力于促进对共鸣的了解，但大多数网络也有一个驱动性的议程，不管是虚拟的还是其他的，它将思想开放的已浮现用户团结在一个共同的目标下。除了超链者，共鸣网络还包括一些非超链者的支持者，他们因为共同的议程而与网络结盟。众所周知，一些非超链者的超人类主义者或觉醒集会和网络成瘾者会帮助超链者找到他们的道路。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]PARTIES AND GUILDS[/b][/size]

In general, there two different types of resonance networks: parties and guilds.

Temporary networks, called parties, don’t have fixed members. Both the number of participants and the specific individuals may vary each time. They usually form temporarily out of mutual interest of the people participating (for instance because of submersion, a shared submersion task, or an echo learning session) and are often set up spontaneously. Its members don’t necessarily share any similar views or social binds. Party sessions are usually announced on a dedicated site that only technomancers are able to find, a short time before the meeting actually takes place. 

Guilds are stable associations similar to magical groups. Although a guild’s members meet exclusively online, may live on different continents, and possibly have never seen each other in the flesh, they feel connected to each other not only because of their abilities but because they share similar goals or beliefs. Guilds are hubs of technomancer communities that allow technomancers to share experiences and resources, practice with Resonance, and find instruction.

While all guilds are primarily devoted to furthering an understanding of Resonance, most networks also have a driving agenda, virtual or otherwise, that unites Emerged and open-minded users under a common purpose. Apart from technomancers, resonance networks also include a number of non-technomancer supporters who have aligned themselves with the network because of a shared agenda. Some non-technomancer transhumanist or Awakened groups and online junkies have been known to help technomancers find their way.
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]限制[/b][/size]

尽管一些网络倾向于对他们的成员和他们追随的支流较为挑剔，具体取决于他们的议程，重点和方向，但共鸣网络一般倾向于更多的自由和更少的限制。集会——由于他们是临时组织的——没有任何限制，但除了教导和网络深潜之外也没有提供任何益处(第141页)。

为了简单起见，公会网络的限制和资源应该按照 Street Magic 第62-74页所介绍的规则来处理，尽管这些在线团体的性质、目的和结构在本质上是不同的。为了反映这些差异，我们提出了以下基本规则的变化，但我们鼓励GM与玩家一起处理这些关联，使这些规则适配他们的游戏。

超链者公会网络中常见的限制包括出席、理念、服务、保密和有限成员(第66-67页，Street Magic)。然而，保密应被视为隐私，这是由于政府和公司对超链者的迫害而采取的预防措施，反映出该网站或网络不为公众所知是由超链者运营的。

更隐秘或组织化的网络，虽然较为少见，但也可能包括契约、服从和物质链接的限制，后者是每个超链者为深潜任务创建的源代码(第141页)的一部分的抵押性存储。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]STRICTURES[/b][/size]

While some networks tend to be very selective about their members and the streams they ride, depending on their agenda, focus, and orientation, resonance networks tend in general to be more liberal and less restrictive. Parties—because of their temporary association—have no limitations but provide no benefits except for instruction and network submersion (p. 141).

For simplicity’s sake, the strictures and resources of guild networks should be handled similarly to those of magical groups, based on the rules introduced on pp. 62–74 of Street Magic, even though the nature, purpose, and structures of these online groups are inherently different. To reflect these differences, the following variations to the basic rules are proposed, but gamemasters are encouraged to handle those associations as it fits their game in conjunction with their players.

Typical strictures that can be encountered in technomancer guild networks are Attendance, Belief, Service, Secrecy, and Limited Membership (pp. 66–67, Street Magic). Secrecy should, however, be treated as Privacy, a precaution taken because of technomancer persecution by governments and corporations, reflecting that the site or network is not publicly known to be run by technomancers.

More secretive or organized networks, though rare, might also include Deed, Obedience, and Material Link, the latter of which is the deposit of each technomancer’s own piece of source code, created as part of a submersion task (p. 141).
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]资源[/b][/size]

虽然大多数网络都有一定程度的资源，这些资源是由每个成员的小额捐款(而不是会费)汇集而成，但网络通常不需要太多的资金、设备或软件来维护网站或推动议程。将大多数网络视为拥有低到中等资源的团体(第68页，Street Magic)。如果这个网络是一个大型数据港，或由于其他原因需要更多的资源，那么可以收取捐款或会员费以允许访问其信息。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]RESOURCES[/b][/size]

While most networks have certain level of resources, pooled from small contributions (but not dues) that each member makes, networks usually don’t require much money, equipment, or software to maintain the site or to fuel their agenda. Treat most networks as groups with Low to Middle Resources (p. 68, Street Magic). If the network is a vast data haven or requires more resources for some other reason, donations or membership fees could be charged to grant access to this information.
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]网络的益处[/b][/size]

成为超链者网络的一部分可以获得几个固有的益处。虽然公会拥有所有的益处，但临时的集会网络只能获得其中一部分。

网络深潜：想要进行深潜的成员可以向网络申请援助。根据第141页(和第238页，SR4)的规则，网络深潜给予深潜的正常业力成本20%(向上取整)的减免。必须预先准备一个恰当的穿越仪式，并至少有三名其他成员出席。网络中超链者的数量等于超链者通过网络深潜所能达到的最高等级。

教导：通过定期互动和密切的意见交流中获得的熟悉程度，使网络成员在涉及共鸣技能、复合程式或技术的教导检定中获得+3骰池修正，无论超链者的支流是什么。当使用学习回声规则(第145页)时，超链者也可以从网络成员处无需深潜地学习回声。

共鸣域搜寻(仅限公会)：如果成员链接到一个共鸣网络中(参见第143页)，共鸣链接允许网络成员在共鸣域搜寻期间访问一个实例时相互陪伴和彼此帮助。成员必须通过相同的后门进入共鸣域，否则可能在共鸣域的不同区域结束。

网络编织(仅公会，仅当链接在一个共鸣网络中)：如果链接到一个共鸣网络中(第143页)，网络成员可以帮助彼此抵抗在团体网络环境中执行检定的衰褪。与执行检定的超链者在同一节点中出现的每个成员向抵抗衰褪的骰池中添加1个骰子。

There are several benefits intrinsic to being part of a technomancer network. While all are available to guilds, only some are available to temporary party networks.

Network Submersion: Members who want to undergo submersion may petition the network for aid. Network submersion grants a 20 percent reduction (round up) to the normal Karma cost of submersion, per the rules on p. 141 (and p. 238, SR4). An appropriate rite of crossing must be prepared in advance and must be attended by at least three other members. The number of technomancer members in a network equals the maximum grade one can achieve via network submersion.

Instruction: The familiarity gained from regular interaction and close exchange of views grants members of a network a +3 dice pool modifier on Instruction Tests involving Resonance skills, complex forms, or techniques, regardless of the technomancer’s stream. When using the Learning Echoes rule (p. 145), technomancers can also learn echoes from members of a network without submersion.

Resonance Realm Search (Guilds only): If the members are linked in a resonance mesh (see p. 143), the resonance link allows members of the network to accompany and aid one another while visiting an instance during a resonance realm search. Members must access the resonance realms through the same backdoor or may end up in different rooms in the resonance realms.

Netweaving (Guilds only, only if linked in a resonance mesh): If linked in a resonance mesh (p. 143), network members may help each other resist Fading for tests performed in the network environment of the group. Add +1 die to the dice pool to resist Fading for each member who is present in the same node as the technomancer performing the test.

[size=12pt][b]共鸣网络[/b][/size]

与魔法协会不同，超链者网络的成员之间并非通过业力纽带相联系，而是通过更复杂的方法来链接到彼此。在得到GM的批准后，超链者可以在深潜后建立与网络的共鸣链接(第238页，SR4)，而不是与另一个超链者的链接。这意味着超链者与所有也使用共鸣链接将自己纳入网络的超链者有一个双向的共鸣链接。通过进阶回声强化共鸣链接(147页)和共鸣交换(148页)将共鸣链接升级到网络，可以进一步提高共鸣网络的能力。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]RESONANCE MESHES[/b][/size]

Contrary to arcane associations, members of a technomancer network don’t bind to each other via karmic bonds but have more sophisticated methods to connect to each other. With the gamemaster’s approval, technomancers may establish a resonance link (p. 238, SR4) to the network instead to another technomancer upon submersion. This means a technomancer has a two-way resonance link to all technomancer members who have also meshed themselves into the network with a resonance link. The abilities of the resonance mesh can further be improved by upgrading the resonance link to the network through the advanced echoes Enhanced Resonance Link (p. 147) and Resonance Exchange (p. 148).

[size=12pt][b]搜索并加入网络[/b][/size]

虽然加入一个超链者网络既不需要检定，也不需要花费业力，但真正找到这个群体却很困难。由于超链者在人口中所占的比例很小，而矩阵中存在的网络数量庞大，所以超链者网络相对来说较为稀少，很难找到。我们鼓励玩家和GM在游戏中扮演超链者寻找这些团体的成员，让超链者角色利用他的人脉和虚拟追踪能力来收集网络位置的线索。

临时的集会网络更容易找到，如果合适的集会已经成立或正在组建(游戏备注：由GM决定)，则可以进行共鸣+数据搜索(8，1天)延续检定来发现它。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]FINDING AND JOINING A NETWORK[/b][/size]

While joining a technomancer network neither requires a test nor costs karma, actually finding the group can be tricky. Due to the small fraction of technomancers within a population, and the sheer number of networks that exist in the Matrix, technomancer networks are comparatively rare and hard to find. Players and gamemasters are encouraged to play out the technomancer’s search for these groups during the game, letting the technomancer’s character draw on his contacts and virtual tracking abilities to assemble clues to the location of the network.

Temporary party networks are easier to find and require a Resonance + Data Search (8, 1 day) Extended Test, if an appropriate party is currently set up or is being formed (gamemaster’s discretion).

[size=12pt][b]协作[/b][/size]

[b]目的：[/b]协作是一个出于共同利益而合作的超链者网络。虽然每个超链者都利用该组织和该组织对超链者“艺术”的综合知识来达到自己的目的，但该网络也作为一个集体反对超链者的敌人，对迫害浮现者的企业和政府组织采取行动并予以惩罚。

[b]成员：[/b]7人(均为来自不同支流的超链者)

[b]限制：[/b]会费，隐私

[b]资源/会费：[/b]中等。会费为每月600新元，用于维护和扩展线上资源，包括为会员提供无限的存储容量，以及在网络安全和保护会员数据库方面提供更充分地隐私。一些资金被用来在需要时购买“可否认的资产”(雇佣暗影狂奔者)；在这种情况下，其中一名组织成员会出演使用约翰逊先生化身的虚拟角色。

[b]描述与特点：[/b]协作(The Cooperative，也被称为Co-op)是一个超链者网络，在“崩溃”事件后不久，女巫狩猎开始之前就已经成立了，由三位名叫Cortex、Wizbyte和Slashdot的前黑客创建，他们试图了解发生在自己身上的事情。他们的结论是，通过合作和汇集关于自身能力的知识，他们可以实现更多的目标，他们是最早形成的超链者网络之一。在超链者浮现期间，他们利用自身能力和网络资源来对抗企业阴谋，招募有前途的成员来对抗超链者的敌人，并雇佣狂奔者来保护超链者或进行破坏活动。尽管从那时起女巫狩猎有所减少，但协作并没有忘记这些公司让公众反对超链者，并导致数人死亡。那些以超链者实验闻名的公司和机构(如MCT或地平线)经常成为协作行动和骇入的目标，他们向他们的主机发送网精或从共鸣域诅咒他们的节点。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]THE COOPERATIVE[/b][/size]

[b]Purpose:[/b] The Cooperative is a technomancer network that works together out of mutual interest. While each technomancer uses the group and the group’s combined knowledge of technomancer "arts" for his own purposes, the network also stands up as a collective against the enemies of technomancers, acting against and punishing corporate and governmental organizations that persecute the Emerged. 

[b]Members:[/b] 7 (all technomancers of different streams) 

[b]Strictures:[/b] Dues, Privacy 

[b]Resources/Dues:[/b] Middle. Dues are 600 nuyen per month, which are used to maintain and expand online resources, including unlimited storage capacity for its members plus more-than-sufficient privacy in terms of network security and protection of the members’ data vaults. Some money is used for “deniable assets” (shadowrunners) when they are needed; on these occasions, one of the group members takes the virtual role of a Mr. Johnson avatar. 

[b]Description and Customs:[/b] The Cooperative (also known as Co-op) is a technomancer network that was already founded before the witch-hunts began shortly after the Crash, by three former hackers known as Cortex, Wizbyte, and Slashdot who met when they were trying to understand what was happening to them. Coming to the conclusion that they could achieve more by cooperating and pooling their knowledge about their abilities, they were among the first technomancer networks to be formed. During the Emergence of technomancers, they used their abilities and their network’s resources against corporate machinations, recruiting promising members in their fight against technomancer enemies and hiring shadowrunners to protect technomancers or commit sabotage. Although witch-hunts have declined since then, the Cooperative has not forgotten the corporations’ methods that turned the public against technomancers, resulting in the deaths of several. Those corporations and institutions with reputations for technomancer experimentation (like MCT or NeoNET) have become frequent targets of Cooperative action and hacks, sending out sprites against their nexi or cursing their nodes from the resonance realm.

[size=12pt][b]奇瓦网[/b][/size]

[b]目的：[/b]奇瓦网倡导超链者融入现实社会，致力于成为超链者与普通矩阵用户通过矩阵进行开放交流和沟通的平台。

[b]会员：[/b]130人(约10名超链者，主要是技术萨满)。

[b]限制：[/b]出席、理念、限制会员(NAN公民)、服务

[b]资源/会费：[/b]奢华，无需会费(全额赞助)。该网络拥有大量节点，并可访问奇瓦网中根深蒂固并受到保护的共鸣井(能级5)。

[b]赞助人：[/b]普韦布洛公司理事会

[b]描述和特点：[/b]2070年秋天，普韦布洛公司理事会(Pueblo Corporate Council，PCC)基于多个萨满的建议创建了奇瓦网，它是一个被称为"奇瓦"(圣地)的虚拟节点网络，致力于实现一个共同目标，即全球社会对超链者的接纳。在PCC的支持下，奇瓦网致力于在PCC的超链者之间和部落社区(以及那些想要参与的NAN社区)之间建立沟通。虽然奇瓦网对非超链者开放，但它有一个核心小组，主要由技术萨满组成，他们负责维护奇瓦节点，教导新浮现的超链者，并主持公开论坛或参与讨论小组以教育公众。大多数技术萨满都追随某种范式，并对理解和与他们结盟的实体和意识进行沟通感兴趣，他们利用网络的共鸣井作为通往共鸣域的门户，与他们的范式交流或探索不同的共鸣域。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]KIVANET[/b][/size]

[b]Purpose:[/b] The KivaNet advocates the integration of technomancers into tribal society and has dedicated itself to act as a platform for open exchange and communication between technomancers and normal Matrix users via the Matrix. 

[b]Members:[/b] 130 (~10 technomancers, mainly technoshamans) 

[b]Strictures:[/b] Attendance, Belief, Limited Membership (NAN citizens), Service 

[b]Resources/Dues:[/b] Luxury, no dues (fully sponsored). The network possesses a plethora of nodes and has access to a resonance well (Rating 5) that is deeply entrenched and safeguarded in the Kiva network.

[b]Patron:[/b] Pueblo Corporate Council

[b]Description and Customs:[/b] Created by the Pueblo Corporate Council on the advice of various shamanic interests in the autumn of 2070, the KivaNet is a network of virtual nodes called "kivas" (holy places) that work toward a common goal, the acceptance of technomancers within global society. Supported by the PCC, the KivaNet works to establish communication among technomancers and between the tribal communities of the PCC (and those of the NAN who want to participate). While the KivaNet is open to nontechnomancers, it has a core group of, mostly, technoshamans, who take care of the kiva nodes, teach newly Emerged technomancers, and moderate or participate in open forums or discussion groups to educate the public. Most technoshamans follow some sort of paragon and are interested in understanding and communication with the entities and ideas they are aligned with, using the network’s resonance well as gateways to the resonance realms to commune with their paragon or explore different resonance realms.

[size=12pt][b]行者[/b][/size]

[b]目的：[/b]“行者“也被一些人称为”导路者”或数字吉普赛，是一个来自伦敦的前宅客部落，在崩溃2.0之后分散在欧洲各地，但在2070年的事件中已经改革为一个虚拟网络。

[b]成员：[/b]24人(13名超链者)

[b]限制：[/b]会费、友爱

[b]资源/会费：[/b]低。会员每年捐款50元。该网络拥有很少的会议中心节点，主要在英国。

[b]描述和特点：[/b]受硝烟影响，由于部落不得不面对的损失(网络崩溃，成员死亡，能力和部落资源的损失)，导路者在崩溃2.0中解散。虽然一些成员之间保持着松散的联系，但大多数成员采用了游牧的生活方式，为了更好的未来离开了英国，在柏林、阿姆斯特丹、华沙或GeMiTo(热那亚、米兰、图卢兹)等欧洲主要大都市的贫瘠地区，在快速变化的世界中挣扎求生。尽管仍然存在的微弱联系在随后的几年里开始瓦解，但2070年的事件导致了部落的改革，虽然仅发生在数字世界。一些留在伦敦的成员复活了部落的前节点，超链者和非超链者开始再次访问系统，重新认识以前的情况，并成长为一个更现代版本的前部落。从那时起，“行者”就开始松散地合作，帮助彼此在新的地理家园中生存，形成了一个横跨欧洲的连接网络。超链者主要负责部落的数字需求，而“凡俗人”，黑客、电子专家和技术奇才经常负责世俗需求，并充当超链者的保护者。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]THE WALKING PEOPLE[/b][/size]

[b]Purpose:[/b] Also called "Routers" or Digital Gypsies by some people, the Walking People is a former otaku tribe, originally from London, that scattered all over Europe in the wake of Crash 2.0 but has reformed virtually as a network during the events in 2070. 

[b]Members:[/b] 24 (13 technomancers) 

[b]Strictures:[/b] Dues, Fraternity 

[b]Resources/Dues:[/b] Low. Members contribute 50 nuyen annu- ally. The network possesses few central nodes for meetings, mainly in the UK.

[b]Description and Customs:[/b] Originating from the Smoke, the Routers disbanded during Crash 2.0 due to the losses (net destruction, deaths, loss of abilities and the tribe’s resources) the tribe had to face. While some members remained in loose contact with each other, most members adopted a nomadic lifestyle and left the United Kingdom for a better future, struggling for survival in a fast-changing world in barren areas of Europe’s major metroplexes like Berlin, Amsterdam, Warsaw, or GeMiTo. While the faint associations that still existed began to crumble over the years that followed, the events of 2070 led to a reformation of the tribe, albeit only in the digital world. When some members who had stayed in London resurrected the tribe’s former node, both technomancers and non-technomancers began visiting the system again, renewing the old familiarities and growing into a more modern version of the former tribe. Since then the Walking People have been loosely working together to help each other survive in their new geographical homes, forming a connected network that spans Europe. While the technomancers mainly take care of the tribe’s digital needs, the “mundanes,” hackers, electronics specialists, and tech-wizards often take care of worldly needs and act as the technomancers’ protectors.
