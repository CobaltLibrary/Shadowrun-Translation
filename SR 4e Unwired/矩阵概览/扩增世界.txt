[color=brown][size=16pt][b]扩增世界[/b][/size][/color]

扩增世界被设计用来吸引消费者对即时满足、简单和易于使用的需求。大多数无线用户很快就适应了有多个屏幕显示数据，这使我们能够满足我们短暂的注意力和对即时新闻、音乐、娱乐的需求，无论我们渴望什么。全球AR覆盖意味着你可以随时随地与任何人交谈。AR扩增的产品，如服装、化妆品和身体扩增，意味着我们永远不必对无聊、平凡的世界作出回应。虚拟俱乐部、社团和社区确保你能在全球范围内遇到志同道合的人，即使你们从未在肉体层面上相遇。对许多用户来说，虚拟世界已经变得比未扩增的世界更真实，当然也更有趣和充实。

日常生活不断被扩增。人们通过他们的AR眼镜或赛博眼观看世界，使用引导他们穿过街道的ARO，享受或无视不断的广告，并观看流媒体新闻或八卦信息。看看你周围的其他人，你会看到他们的扩增外观--也许他们穿着嵌入了AR功能的衣服，当通过AR观看时，一件普通的连体衣变成了一团颜色和纹理的漩涡。化妆品和头发/皮肤产品也有类似的作用。用AR扩增的化妆品覆盖你的脸，你的特征会变成你能想象的任何东西。头发可以变成蠕动的蛇群或自然界中从未见过的颜色。

在社交方面，越来越多的人转向虚拟世界来寻找伴侣和浪漫。约会网络(以及它们用来淹没我们的垃圾邮件)比海里的鱼还要普遍。在过去的几年里，包括UCAS在内的许多国家已经给予虚拟婚姻(和虚拟离婚)以法律地位。当然，这意味着你可以在网上遇到你的真爱，跑到虚拟的拉斯维加斯，在虚拟的埃尔维斯教堂里举行婚礼，然后享受虚拟的蜜月。

[color=brown][size=16pt][b]THE AUGMENTED WORLD[/b][/size][/color]
The augmented world has been designed to appeal to consumers’ desire for instant gratification, simplicity, and ease of use. Most wireless users adapted quickly to having multiple screens of data displayed, allowing us to satisfy our short-attention spans and need for instantaneous news, music, entertainment, whatever we desire. Global AR coverage means you can talk to anyone, anywhere, anytime. AR-enhanced products like clothing, makeup, and body augmentations mean we never have to make due with the boring, mundane world. Virtual clubs, societies, and communities ensure that you’ll meet like-minded folks around the globe, even if you never meet in the flesh. For many users, the virtual world has become more real—and certainly more interesting and fulfilling—than the unaugmented world. 

Daily life is constantly augmented. People view the world through their AR glasses or cybereyes, using the AROs that guide them through the streets, enjoying or ignoring the constant barrage of advertisements, and watching streaming news or gossip feeds. Look at other people crowding around you and you’ll see their augmented appearance—perhaps they are wearing clothes embedded with AR functionality, changing a plain bodysuit into a swirling mass of colors and textures when viewed through AR. Makeup and hair/skin products do similar things. Cover your face with AR-enhanced makeup and your features will change into anything you can imagine. Hair can be transformed into writhing masses of snakes or colors never seen in nature. 

Socially, more and more people are turning to the virtual world to find companionship and romance. Dating networks (and the spam they inundate us with) are more common than fish in the sea. In the last few years, many countries including the UCAS have granted legal status to virtual marriages (and virtual divorces). Which means, of course, that you can meet your true love online, run off to virtual Las Vegas, get hitched in a virtual Church of Elvis ceremony, and then enjoy a virtual honeymoon.

[size=16pt][b]知识也许就在你的指尖[/b][/size]

扩增世界最有用的好处是能够即时获取信息。有人在会议上引用了一个60年代民权领袖的晦涩的演讲？发出一个带有几个关键词的检索，在几秒钟内你就可以得到整个演讲，一个简洁的纲要版本，几个关于社会和经济影响的相关评论，一段演讲者的生活史......现在你明白了。对购买新车感兴趣？发出检索，得到附近的经销商，有竞争力的报价，消费者评级，安全测试评级，可靠性指南，以及详细介绍了他们对同一品牌和型号的体验的最近车主的博客。对商场对面的那个可爱的家伙感到好奇？阅读他的资料，发现他喜欢战斗摩托，并在你走过去的时候检索最近的摩托新闻。当你走到他身边时，你可以有一个完美的开场白。

检索信息是直观的，简单的，而且(通常)是低成本的。任何人都可以做一个基本的检索--通讯链和软件会完成所有的工作。真的没有理由不知道。而且，这并不是简单地将"书本"知识储存在矩阵中。你可以检索有关文化、习俗、适当的礼仪、俚语，甚至当前的贿赂费率等信息。你可以听到母语人士礼貌(或粗鲁)的问候，观看帮派语言的例子，或浏览关于日本茶道礼仪的逐步说明(有实况教学，以防你正在开会并不想因缺乏礼仪而冒犯他人)。

[size=16pt][b]KNOWLEDGE AT YOUR FINGERTIPS PERHAPS[/b][/size]
the most useful benefit of the augmented world is the ability to instantaneously access information. Someone references an obscure speech by a 1960’s civil rights leader at a meeting? Send out a search with a few keywords, and within seconds you can have the entire speech, a Cliff’s Quickie™ version, several relevant commentaries on the social and economic impact, a life history for the speaker … you get the point. Interested in purchasing a new vehicle? Send a search out and get nearby dealerships, competitive price quotes, consumer ratings, safety test-ratings, reliability guides, and blogs of recent owners detailing their experiences with the same make and model. Curious about that cute guy across the mall? Read his profile, see he loves combat biking, and search for recent biking news while you walk over. By the time you’re next to him, you can have a perfect opening line. 

Searching for information is intuitive, simple, and (generally) low-cost. Anyone can do a basic search—the commlink and software do all the work. There’s really no reason to be ignorant. And it isn’t simply “book” knowledge stored on the Matrix. You can search for information on cultures, customs, proper etiquette, slang, even current bribe rates. You can hear native speakers giving courteous (or rude) greetings, watch examples of gang handlanguage, or see step-by-step instructions on proper Japanese tea ceremony etiquette (with live instruction, in case you’re at a meeting and don’t want to offend with your lack of manners).
