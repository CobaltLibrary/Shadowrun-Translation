[color=brown][size=16pt][b]矩阵与日常生活[/b][/size][/color]

> 我们这些接入点上的人已经讨论这个合集有一段时间了。似乎每个人都沉浸在觉醒世界里或是在谈论最新最大的枪。虽然我同意魔法是每个狂奔者都最好纳入考虑的东西，但矩阵将会比任何关于魔法的讨论更适合普通狂奔者、薪奴或寄居者们。星界空间只对少数人开放，但只要花上硬件的钱，虚拟空间将对任何地点的任何人开放。现在是2071年，泛人类已经创造了一个全新的世界。让我们来看看吧。

我们这些生活在阴影里的人可能与大街上的普通人相差甚远。不过，知道世界上的薪奴们在做什么从来都没有坏处; 今天的无辜路人就是明天的目标。因此，我为那些遵守法律的人收集了一些有关日常生活的信息。

大多数人从未尝试超越矩阵的肤浅层次，认为它不过是一个增进虚拟社交、更方便的购物、可挑选的娱乐，当然，还有工作的场所。沟通是这里的关键，因为这是大多数人与朋友、老板、同事甚至与家人交谈的主要方式。

在崩溃之前，大多数家庭都有一个中央赛博终端。它集电脑、交易、电话/电子邮件服务、信息中心、拟感……所有功能于一体。现在，赛博终端已经被压缩成一个可以随时随地带在身边的私人通讯链，将你与AR世界连接起来。伴随着现在比想象中更快的信号传输速度，全球通讯不再存在任何障碍。矩阵是让你的生活跟上节奏并让你尽情享受的终极方式。你可以在一个AR屏幕上阅读你的八卦新闻，在另一个AR窗口上有方向指引你去最近的咖啡店，在第三个AR窗口里与新加坡的人交谈。曾几何时，你会看到有人在街上边走边自言自语，你会觉得他们疯了。现在你可以走在任何城市的街道上，你会看到戴着AR眼镜的人群，与只有他们能看到或听到的人交谈。当然，你要让你的家人习惯植入通讯链，通常是那些年纪大的人，他们似乎不太能随波逐流，像其他年轻人一样疯狂。然而，在16-25岁的人群中，数据插口和植入通讯链是如此的"60年代"——至少我被告知如此。

[size=16pt][b]MATRIX AND EVERYDAY LIFE[/b][/size]

> A couple of us here on Jackpoint have been discussing this collection for a while now. Seems like everyone’s always going off on the Awakened world or talking about the newest and biggest guns. While I’ll agree that magic is something every runner better take into account, the Matrix is gonna be a lot more relevant to the average runner, wage slave or squatter than any discussion of magic. Astral space is accessible only to a select few, but virtual space is accessible to everyone, everywhere, for only the price of hardware. It’s 2071 and metahumanity has created a whole new world. Let’s go for a tour.

> Pistons

Those of us in the shadows can be pretty far out of touch with the average Joe on the streets. It never hurts to know what the wageslaves of the world are doing, though; today’s innocent bystander is tomorrow’s mark. To that end, I’ve gathered some info on everyday life for those people who actually live within the law. 
Most people never venture past the superficial levels of the Matrix, considering it little more than a venue for increased virtual socialization, more convenient shopping, on-demand entertainment, and, of course, work. Communication is key here, since it is the primary way most people talk to their friends, their bosses, their colleagues, even their families.
Back before the Crash, most homes had a central cyberterminal. It was an all-in-one computer, trid, phone/email service, message center, simsense … everything. Now that cyberterminal has been condensed into a personal commlink that’s carried with you everywhere, all the time, connecting you to the AR world 24/7. With today’s faster-than-thought transmission speeds, there are no global barriers any more. The Matrix is the ultimate way to bring your life up to speed and let you live it to the fullest. You can read your gossip news in one AR screen, have directions guide you to the nearest coffee shop in another AR window, and be talking to someone in Singapore in a third. Once upon a time you’d see someone walking down the street and talking to themselves, and you’d figure they’d lost it. Now you can walk down any urban street and you’ll see crowds of people, AR glasses on, holding conversations with people only they can see or hear. Sure, you get your folks with built in ‘links, mostly older folk who just can’t quite seem to go with the flow and act like raving lunatics with the rest of the youngsters. Among the 16–25 demographic, though, datajacks and internal ‘links are just so “2060-ish”—or so I’ve been told.
[/spoiler]

> 在最近的超链者恐慌中，拥有植入通讯链的人经常成为无知、恐惧的人群的目标。甚至我们之中拥有植入通讯链的人也开始携带一个通讯链来避免这种危险。

> Glitch

AR通讯的变化的另一个副作用是，人们大多使用他们的图标作为他们的虚拟形象。过去，你必须坐在你的赛博终端前，或者盯着你的袖珍秘书的小屏幕/摄像头，才能与世界各地的某人进行视频对话。现在，除非你愿意四处走动，在说话时拿着相机对着自己的脸，否则别人看到的就是你的图标，而不是你的脸。

这项技术可以创造一个虚拟的"你"，一个完美的你自己的表现，带有各种癖好和个人怪癖，并把它用作你的图标。这在几年前风靡一时。不过，最新的流行趋势是使用可定制的"化身"，比如地平线的"完美拟合"，它允许用户创建一个理想版的自己。既然这么多人都只在网络空间互动，那为什么不做自己想做的人呢? 如今，只有语音通话的通讯已经难得一见了，仅限于见不得人的商业交易和有被害妄想症的暗影狂奔者。

[spoiler]
> With the recent technomancer scare, people with internal commlinks were frequently targeted by ignorant, fearful crowds. Even those of us with internal ‘links started carrying a commlink to avoid that danger.

> Glitch

Another side-effect of the AR communication change is that people mostly use their icons as their virtual representation. Used to be you had to be sitting in front of your cyberterminal or staring into the tiny screen/camera of your pocket secretary to have a videoenabled conversation with someone around the globe. Now, unless you’re willing to walk around, carrying a camera pointed to your face while you talk, your icon is what the other person sees, not your face.
The technology exists to create a virtual “you,” a perfect representation of yourself complete with mannerisms and personal quirks, and use it as your icon. That was all the rage a few years back. The newest fashion, though, is to use customizable “personas,” like Horizon’s Perfect Fit, which allows a user to create an idealized version of themselves. Since so many people interact solely in cyberspace, why not be exactly who you want to be? Nowadays a voice-only call is unusual, limited to shady business deals and paranoid shadowrunners.

[size=14pt][b]商业[/b][/size]

商业世界在金融危机的余波中举步维艰。因此，当矩阵被重建后，服务提供商确保它不会再次崩溃(或者他们希望我们这么相信)，建立了一个覆盖大部分大都市地区的无线网络。考虑到硬件和基础设施受到的破坏，重建老式的有线电信系统(更不用说维护了)是没有利益的。现在，大多数企业已经完全投入到无线通信的大潮中。这对他们和我们来说都是快速、简捷且有利可图的。

通过增强现实技术，员工可以在家、在路上、甚至在流动的工作环境中登录。人们认为虚拟办公室方便、快捷，而且最重要的是它的成本效益。没有中央办公室，薪奴成为了他们自己的移动办公室，从而消除了维护中央大楼的成本，增加了员工的可用时间，并确保业务可以全年无休地运行。

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]BUSINESS[/b][/size]
The business world was crippled in the aftermath of the crash. As a result, when the Matrix was rebuilt, the service providers ensured it could never crash again (or so they’d like us to believe), building a web of wireless coverage that blankets most metro areas. Given the damage done to hardware and the infrastructure, it quickly became obvious that rebuilding—much less maintaining—the old-fashioned wired telecom system wasn’t profitable. Now most corps have jumped fully on the wireless bandwagon. It’s quick, easy, and profitable—for them and for us.
Through AR, employees can be logged in from home, from the road, or even from nomadic work environments. Virtual offices are considered convenient, quick to set up, and most importantly cost-efficient. With no central offices, wageslaves become their own mobile offices, eliminating the costs of maintaining central buildings, increasing the amount of hours an employee can be available, and ensuring business can run 24/7/365.
[/spoiler]

> 这种商业方式的安全漏洞为我们这样的有事业心的罪犯留下了空间。想要黑进一个安全网络? 只需要去拜访会计鲍勃，然后通过他的系统登录，瞧! 当然，大公司通常会将他们的员工安置在安全的公司领地，以阻止这种努力，这使得这种方法更复杂了一点。

> Glitch

> 然而，对于真正敏感的东西，比如那些令人垂涎的新无人机的诱人的研发规格，公司把任何东西和任何人都锁在一个安全的建筑或园区里。

> Slamm-0!

> 当你利用那样的安全漏洞时，不要欺骗自己，以为自己可以侥幸逃脱。就像预算中的其他项目一样，公司也要对缩水(即由于盗窃、数据泄露和其他来源造成的损失)进行解释。当底线受到威胁时，它们往往会主动管理这些损失。

> Mr. Bonds

[spoiler]
> The security holes in this business approach leave room for enterprising criminals like us. Want to hack into a secure network? Just drop in to visit Bob-the-Accountant at home, log on through his system, and Voila! Of course, big corps often house their employees in secure corporate enclaves to thwart such efforts, making this approach a bit more complicated. 

> Glitch

> For the real sensitive stuff, though, like those juicy R&D specs for that new drone you’re drooling over, corps lock everything—and everyone—down in a secured building or campus. 

> Slamm-0!

> Don’t fool yourselves into thinking you’re getting away with something when you take advantage of a security hole like that. Corps account for “shrink”—losses from theft, data breaches, and other sources—just like any other line item on their budget. They also tend to be proactive in managing those losses when the bottom line is threatened.

> Mr. Bonds
[/spoiler]

其他公司则提供完全可插电式的办公室，薪奴可以在这里工作，插上电源，然后在AR办公室里度过接下来的12个小时，没有外界干扰，不会妨碍他们的满额工作效率。在高度安全的地区，系统可能与员工完全脱机，要求员工在门口"检查"他们的私人通讯链，而在现场使用工作场所的通讯链。当然，这确实会导致大量员工精疲力竭，但是，嘿，人是可以被替代的，对吧?

企业还发现，使用AR技术进行培训、监控员工和传播企业的垃圾信息非常容易。AR的传输很容易被窃听，在新的AR世界里，员工无论在工作还是在家里都没有隐私。当然，大多数薪奴并不知道他们的企业老板在密切关注着他们。我当然不会是那个宣布这个消息的人。

AR技术还允许企业更好地在危险或困难的环境中部署他们的人员，如采矿、水下环境，甚至建筑。通过使用RFID标签和AR，企业可以通过持续监视每一个工人，警告他危险的区域，防止他进入不安全的区域，监测生命体征和生产力，从而降低风险。

[spoiler]
Other corporations provide fully jacked-in offices where wageslaves go, plug in, and then spend the next twelve hours in a VR office, with no outside distractions to hamper full productivity. In high security areas, the system may be completely off line with employees required to “check” their personal commlinks at the door and use a workplace ‘link while on site. Of course, this does lead to a high number of burnout employees, but hey, people are replaceable, right? 
Businesses have also discovered the ease of using AR for training, monitoring employees, and disseminating corporate bullshit. AR transmissions are so easy to eavesdrop on, employees in the new AR world have no privacy at work or at home. Of course, most wageslaves have no idea of how closely their corporate masters are watching. I certainly am not going to be the one to break the news. 
AR technology has also allowed corporations to better deploy their personnel in dangerous or difficult environments, such as mining, underwater environments, and even construction. By using RFID tags and AR, corporations can reduce risk through constant surveillance of every worker, warning him of dangerous zones, preventing entry into unsecured areas, and monitoring vital signs and productivity.
[/spoiler]

> 越来越多的公司正在使用廉价的(即一次性的)劳动力，并在他们身上植入一些劣质的技能闭路，一夜之间创造出工人。它具有很大的灵活性，因为企业可以在任何时候将新的技能/培训能力下载到他们的劳动力中。这比在员工身上投入多年的培训、教育和时间要划算得多。

> Aufheben

> 技能闭路不合格，医疗保健也不存在，公司从员工的工资中扣除手术和设备的费用。一旦他们加上利息和所有额外的护理、升级和日常维护费用，员工就会成为几个月甚至几年的无薪奴隶。

> Nephrine

> 我不知道还有什么能比这些更糟糕，看到这么多的人放弃他们的身体和灵魂，只为了靠微薄的工资生存，或是看到更多未受训的工人被完全自动化的工厂和廉价的无人机劳动力取代，而这些是这么多企业所依赖的，迫使泛人类工人在污染自己的身体或眼睁睁看着家人挨饿之间做出选择。

> Fatima

> 无人机很容易制造，也很容易控制，而且你不会遇到泛人类劳动力所固有的昂贵的错误。世界就是这样。如果可怜的啜泣者想要离开，他们可以做到。我就这么做了。 

> Butch

> 虽然伦理学课很有趣，但我宁愿把时间花在有意义的事情上。无人机劳动力是生活的现实。一个聪明的狂奔者知道如何利用这些优势。如果你的黑客能进入系统，他们就能控制这个地方。这是一个巨大的优势。

> 2XL

> 妈的，最可怕的是有些地方有安保黑客和机师值班。没有什么比让一个团队进入一个地方，却发现有一个蜘蛛，一个可以跳入安保系统并"成为"建筑的安保机师更糟糕的了。几周前，我走进一个满是超链者的实验室，一个警报被触发了。当我们的黑客在大楼的系统中战斗而我们其他人在试图对付安保无人机时，那只该死的蜘蛛下载了一套新的技能软件到这群普通人身上。把他们从实验室的普通员工变成了训练有素的安保部队。在短短几秒钟内，我们就有了100多名突然明白了如何狠狠踢我们屁股的兽人。不用说，我们逃了。

> DangerSensei

[spoiler]
> More and more corporations are taking cheap (read: disposable) labor and slapping some shoddy skillwires into them, creating workers overnight. It makes for great flexibility, since the corp can download new skills/training into their workforce at any time. Much more cost-efficient than investing years of training, education, and time into employees. 

> Aufheben

> The skillwires are substandard, the healthcare non-existent, and the corp charges the employee for the cost of the surgery and gear, taking it out of their wages. The employee is an unpaid slave for months, if not years, once they tack on interest and all the extra costs of care, upgrades, and routine maintenance. 

> Nephrine

> I don’t know what’s worse, seeing so many sign away their bodies and souls just to survive on the pitiful wages offered, or seeing even more of the unskilled workers displaced by the fully automated factories and cheap drone labor that so many corps rely upon, leaving metahuman workers with the choice between polluting their bodies or watching their families starve. 

> Fatima

> Drones are easy to build, easy to control, and you don’t get the costly screw-ups inherent in a metahuman workforce. It’s the way of the world. If the poor SOBs want to get out, they can. I did. 

> Butch

> While the ethics lecture is entertaining, I’d rather spend my time productively. Drone workforces are a fact of life. A smart runner knows how to use them to his advantage. If your hacker can get into the system, they can control the place. Talk about a great advantage.

> 2XL

> Shit, what’s scary is that some of these places have security hackers and riggers on duty. Nothing worse than getting a team into a place only to realize there’s a spider—a security rigger—who can jump into the security system and “become” the building. A few weeks back I got into a lab full of skillwired grunts and an alarm got set off. While our hacker was fighting through the building’s system and the rest of us were trying to deal with the security drones, the damn spider downloaded a new set of skillsofts into the grunts. Transformed the bunch from lab grunts to trained security forces. In a matter of seconds, we had 100-plus orks who suddenly knew a hell of a lot about kicking our asses. Needless to say, we left.

增强现实的另一大商业利益是把东西卖给所有的薪奴(还有你)。很多很多的东西。通过实时跟踪你的每一笔购买。你进入的每一家商店，你光顾的每一家餐馆，甚至是你今早加到咖啡里的豆浆……好吧，这么说吧，系统比你更了解你和你的喜好。没过多久，企业就意识到数据跟踪是一种多么有利可图的业务。你的购买模式面临着非常激烈的竞争，每个有SIN和可支配收入的人都是目标。当你走在大街上的时候，你会被餐馆每天的特色菜轰炸，商店为你最喜欢的内衣品牌做广告，街边小贩用病毒式广告软件攻击你，娱乐场所闪烁着AR霓虹灯招牌来吸引你的注意……在任何商业中心，都不可能逃脱持续不断的数据攻击。任何时候，只要你对其中一个广告表现出兴趣，你的注意力就会被记录下来，并与你的其他消费资料一起编辑。企业的利益确保了将你的通讯链转换为隐藏模式(或将其扔到最近的回收商)是可疑的或非法的，而且几乎总是会让你被警察或安保部队注意到。对于大街上的普通人来说，持续不断的广告战争是生活中一个简单的事实。然而，对于狂奔者，我强烈建议，如果你开始收到按你的方式个性化的广告，这是一个明确的信号，是时候扔掉你现有的ID，买一个新的了。

[spoiler]
The other big business interest in AR is selling stuff to all those wageslaves (and you). Lots and lots of stuff. With the ability to track every purchase you make, real-time. Every store you enter, every restaurant you patronize, right down to the soymilk you added to your coffee this morning … well, let’s just say, the system knows more about you and your preferences, than you do. It didn’t take long for corporations to realize what a lucrative business market-data tracking is. There’s some seriously heavy competition out there for your buying patterns, and everyone with a SIN and disposable income is targeted. You walk down the street and get bombarded with restaurants reciting their daily specials, stores advertising sales of your preferred brand of underwear, street side vendors blasting you with viral ad-software, entertainment parlors flashing neon AR signs to get your attention … it is impossible to escape the constant data assault in any commercial center. Any time you actually show interest in one of the ads, your attention is noted and compiled with the rest of your consumer profile. Corporate interests have ensured that turning your commlink to hidden mode (or chucking it into the nearest recycler) is suspicious or illegal, and will almost always get you noticed by police or security forces. For the average Joe on the street, the constant ad-war is a simple fact of life. For runners, however, I’d highly recommend that if you begin to have personalized ads sent your way, it is a sure sign that it’s time to chuck your current ID and buy a new one.

[size=14pt][b]你是谁？无线世界的ID[/b][/size]

你的系统识别编码(SIN)是在你出生时或你更改国籍或企业国籍时发给你的唯一标识符。这个标识符(不仅仅是字母数字)包含基本信息，比如你的生日、出生地和其他数据，这些信息编码在标识符中。如果你在出生时就获得了SIN，那么你的SIN将与基本的生物特征数据联系在一起，比如DNA样本、视网膜扫描和指纹。随着年龄的增长，可以添加额外的生物识别数据，如声音模式、面部特征和手部测量。你的SIN是在你的国家或公司注册的，同时也在全球SIN登记处注册。在崩溃之后，大多数政府和企业开始要求多个备份数据库，以便在国家级紧急状况下可以访问这些数据库。

你的ID包含与其他公民、政府/企业机构、实体或在线零售商互动所需的所有数据。尽管每个发放ID的国家/公司都在公民ID上嵌入了不同的数据，但它们通常包含你的姓名、年龄、泛人种类型、身体描述、当前照片、凭证，并经常与你的银行账户联系在一起。如果你是觉醒者或超链者，许多国家还要求ID包含你的状态，以及你拥有的任何赛博或生体殖装的注册状态。

你的SIN与你的生物特征数据相关联，证明你是一名公民。你的ID意味着你是谁。它们让你在今天的世界中生存。

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]WHO ARE YOU?: I.D. IN THE WIRELESS WORLD[/b][/size]
Your System Identification Number is a unique identifier issued to you at birth or any time you change national or corporate citizenship. This identifier (which is not just alpha-numeric) contains basic information, such as your birthdate, birthplace, and other data, encoded within the identifier. If issued at birth, your SIN will be linked to basic biometric data, such as a DNA sample, retinal scan, and finger prints. As you age, additional biometrics such as voice patterns, facial patterns, and hand measurements can be added. Your SIN is registered with your country or corporation of citizenship as well as with the Global SIN Registry. Following the Crash, most governments and corporations began requiring multiple backup databases that can be accessed in case of national emergency. 
Your id contains all the data necessary to interact with other citizens, government/corporate agencies, and physical or online retailers. Although every issuing country/corp embeds different data on a citizen’s ID, they generally contain your name, age, metatype, a physical description, a current photo, licenses, and are frequently linked to your bank account. Many countries also require IDs to contain your status if you are Awakened or a technomancer along with registries of any cyber or bioware you have. 
Your SIN is linked to biometric data and proves you are a citizen. Your ID is who you are. Together, they allow you to exist in today’s world.
