> 啊，科尔先生。很高兴见到你。当然，你并不是我原本预期会见到的人。
> Silk

> 你知道我是谁，即使你不知道我会来。
> Ringmaster

> 这就是情报的本质——永远不完整，永远在增长。我们总是在拼图，一块又一块。有时会有几块拼图聚在一起，整体图像也就变得更清晰了。
> Silk

> 所以，你知道我来是为了什么？
> Ringmaster

> 我了解巨龙间的事务。我知道你我其实在同一个圈子活动。我们的道路早该交汇了。
> Silk

> 迪斯正在逼近。这可不只是巨龙们的问题。
> Ringmaster

> 巨龙们倒是也这么想，虽然有些不太谦逊。我敢肯定阿勒什有时也和我的主人们一样难以理解。
> Silk

> 我不会称她为我的主人，或者女主人。
> Ringmaster

> 我也敢肯定她从未用那种语言与你交流过。邓凯尔赞在我面前也从未这么做过。
> Silk

> 虽然我对此非常感激，但我今天是为了正事而来。
> Ringmaster

> 是的，迪斯。我猜你是来索取我手上为数不多的东西了。
> Silk

> 或许没你想得那么少，不过我很乐意听听。
> Ringmaster

> 给。我已经把我们掌握的资料整理好了。
> Silk

> 我以为你没预料到我会来？
> Ringmaster

> 如果不是你，那也会是别人。说实话，我很高兴是你。你愿意听个简要概况吗？要不要喝一杯？
> Silk

> 只听概况吧，谢谢。
> Ringmaster

> 希望你不介意我自己喝点。请随意。目前，巨龙基金会对迪斯所构成的威胁并没有正式立场。
> Silk

> 迪斯自己都不够“正式”，不足以让任何机构给出正式立场。
> Ringmaster

> 好吧，科尔先生，公众归公众，内部默许则是另一回事。基金会内部其实存在分歧。你必须明白，我们过去所遵循的命令和默认的优先级已经……越来越模糊了。邓凯尔赞的遗嘱并不是永恒的神谕。这就留下了解读未来目标和行动方向的空间。
> Silk

> 内部冲突？
> Ringmaster

> 几乎没有。也许这让人意外，毕竟巨龙基金会在形式上已基本成为一家公司，唯一的问题是：在业务多样化的同时，如何忠于我们的创始原则。考虑到我们仍在为某些觉醒威胁设立悬赏，我们既需要为初期投资之外的长期运作创造收入来源，也要想办法处理我们所接收到的某些“东西”。
> Silk

> 所以是实验？研究？
> Ringmaster

> 都有。还有更多。例如，我们有充分理由相信，血魔法本身并非天生危险，而只是被过早地投入使用。而关于HMHVV，甚至伊瓦依[color=green](Invae, 虫精魂的神秘学称呼)[/color]，在医疗领域的潜力也很明显，更不用说那些用于抑制它们威胁的手段了。
> Silk

> 虽然你后面那些说法让我有点不安，但这留待以后再谈——如果我们这次能熬过去的话。说到这，我听说你们雇佣过的不少暗影资产现在都在逃，头上还被挂了赏金。
> Ringmaster

> 的确。这极大地拖慢了我们的运作。甚至在极少数情况下，迫使我们动用自己的赏金。这并不是我们理想中的局面，但我正在想办法补救。我欠其中一些人不少情，比如你们的麦考德上校。他为基金会效力多年，表现非常出色。
> Silk

> 的确如此。但我们还是回到主题。你提到对迪斯缺乏立场……
> Ringmaster

> 是的。我们现有的资源并没有直接投入到对抗迪斯人及其“浮士德信徒”上。我一直尽我所能通过悬赏系统处理此事，通常是伪装成我们常规任务目标的方式。我很确定基金会内部有人知道我在做什么，但几乎没人提出反对。
> Silk

> 这说明你手里有明确的打击目标。
> Ringmaster

> 没错。我们用来识别其他威胁的方法在这方面也相当有效。当然，还有信息网络，以及我们从被俘目标身上提取出的情报。你知道吗？这个世界上的怪物们已经察觉到某些事情正在发生，尽管它们可能说不出名字来。
> Silk

> 你觉得你能把这些力量整合起来？重组它们？
> Ringmaster

> 去召集那些根本不存在的雇佣兵？
> Silk

> 要求太高了吗？
> Ringmaster

> 我只是一直在等待有人提出这个要求。
> Silk

> Ah, Mr. Cole. A pleasure. Not who I was expecting, of course.
> Silk
> You knew who I was, even if you didn’t know I was coming.
> Ringmaster
> That’s the nature of information. Always incomplete. Always growing. Puzzles we’re looking to complete, piece by piece. Every once in a great while, a couple clusters come together, and the greater picture becomes clearer.
> Silk
> So, you know why I’m here?
> Ringmaster
> I know about the business of greater dragons. I know you and I are effectively moving in the same circles. Seems about time our paths crossed.
> Silk
> Dis is closing in. That’s hardly the exclusive problem of the dragons.
> Ringmaster
> Dragons tend to think the same way, though less modestly. I’m sure Arleesh has proven as difficult to understand at times as my own masters have been.
> Silk
> I wouldn’t call her my master, or even mistress.
> Ringmaster
> And I’m sure she never uses that language directly with you. Certainly, Dunkelzahn never did with me.
> Silk
> While I appreciate that, I’m here on business.
> Ringmaster
> Yes. Dis. I suppose you want what little I have to offer.
> Silk
> Maybe not so little as you think, but I’d be happy to hear it.
> Ringmaster
> Here. I’ve taken the liberty of compiling what we have.
> Silk
> I thought you weren’t expecting me.
> Ringmaster
> If it wasn’t you, it would have been someone. Frankly, I’m glad it’s you. Perhaps you’d care for an overview? A drink while you listen?
> Silk
> Just the overview, thank you.
> Ringmaster
> I hope you don’t mind if I indulge. Make yourself comfortable. At present, the Draco Foundation has no official stance on the threat Dis represents.
> Silk
> Dis aren’t official enough to warrant an official stance by anyone.
> Ringmaster
> Come, Mr. Cole, there’s public and there’s tacit, internal. The Foundation is divided, internally. You must understand, the orders we once had, the implied priorities we used to follow, they’re running … thin. Dunkelzahn’s Will was hardly an infinite oracle for us. That has left room for interpretation of future goals and initiatives.
> Silk
> Internal conflicts?
> Ringmaster
> Very little. Maybe surprising, as the DF has effectively become a corporation in form, the only question is how to stay true to our founding principles as we diversify. Given the ongoing funding for bounties for certain Awakened threats, we have the dual need to provide ongoing income beyond the investments made for our initial setup as well as finding some use for what is brought to us.
> Silk
> Experimentation, then? Examination?
> Ringmaster
> All that and more. We have every reason to believe blood magic is not inherently dangerous but has simply been brought into use far ahead of its proper time, for example. And the medical possibilities in HMHVV and even the Invae should be obvious, to say nothing of the means of moderating them as threats.
> Silk
> While I find some of those latter statements a bit disconcerting, that’s a conversation for another time, assuming the outcome of our current situation. Speaking of, I understand numerous shadow assets who have been employed by you are now on the run with prices on their heads.
> Ringmaster
> Indeed. It’s slowed down our operations quite a bit. Forced us to employ some of our own bounties, in some rare instances. Not our ideal circumstance, but I’m working to remedy that. I owe some of those assets more than a little loyalty. Like your own Colonel McCord, for example. He served the Foundation quite well for many years.
> Silk
> Indeed. But we should stay on topic. You mentioned a lack of astance on Dis …
> Ringmaster
> Yes. What resources we have available are not being put directly against Disians and their Faustians. I was doing my best with our bounty system, usually falsely classifying targets by our usual mandated profile. I’m quite sure others inside knew what I was up to, but there was little objection.
> Silk
> That implies you have targets to pick.
> Ringmaster
> Indeed. The same methodology we apply to finding other threats works fairly well. And of course, there’s the inevitable networks of information and what we extract from apprehended targets. You realize the monsters of the world have gotten wise to what’s happening, even if they can’t put a name to it?
> Silk
> Do you think you could bring these forces to bear? Reorganize them?
> Ringmaster
> Rallying mercenaries that don’t even exist?
> Silk
> Too tall an order?
> Ringmaster
> I’ve just been waiting for someone to give it to.
> Silk

出席者：肯德拉·德·桑托斯（人类，女性，巨龙阿勒什之声），埃德温·罗斯瑟（人类，男性，巨龙塞勒迪尔之声）

> 感谢你在这么短的时间内与我见面，埃德温。我明白这对你来说一定很麻烦。
> KDS

> 无论是风雨交加，还是末日审判的威胁，都无法阻止我履行我主的事务。但在我们继续之前，我的主人希望你的女主人能尽快从她在汽车城所受的伤中恢复。他对她目前的状况感到非常不安，对事件发生的经过同样感到忧虑。
> Rosser

> 谢谢。她曾对科尔局长说过：“当时看起来是个好主意。” 不过，她一方面会对你们的关心感到欣慰，另一方面也会因你主得知她虚弱的状况而感到恼火。她一直非常努力地保密此事，甚至对她的同类也是如此。
> KDS

> 我明白。但情报终归是我主的事务。不过她可以放心，我的主人是她的同类中唯一知情者，并且会对该情报保密到极致。这类情报即便是在盟友之间也可能引发不稳定的影响。如果还需要额外的医疗协助，我的主人是唯一有能力提供帮助的。
> Rosser

> 同意，也感谢你。但我们还是回到正题上来，也就是这次会面的真正原因。你们关于迪斯语的项目进展如何？
> KDS

> 借助超统神经网络开发的新译码器，我们正在翻译和解密积压的大量旧数据和记录。不幸的是，我们面对的是多达1.2gp的数据积压。
> Rosser

> (清晰可辨的叹息声)我原本希望听到更好的消息，但至少我们有了一个开始。
> KDS

> 恐怕我还有更糟的消息要带来。我的主人优先处理了几份他确信包含重要信息的文件，结果证明他是对的。信息涉及迪斯收割机网络的建立。看来时间表已经加速。我们原本可能还有数年时间，现在可能只剩几个月，网络就会启动。一旦启动，我们就无法在不摧毁物质界的情况下阻止它。所以，我们要么等死，要么自毁家园。
> Rosser

> (无法翻译的语言)抱歉，我学了一些我女主人的语言。在我极度愤怒时它就会脱口而出。
> KDS

> 无需道歉，但我得夸你发音非常准确。不过我还有一条关键信息必须告知。尽管正在建造的是一个中央网络，但我们获得的计划中也表明还有几个辅助网络，或者至少是一些分支网络也在建设中。就像一个矩阵系统一样，一旦主网络被关闭或摧毁，这些辅助网络会立即接管其功能。
> Rosser

> 那我们显然一刻也不能耽搁。我会立刻通知我的女主人以及科尔局长。我们必须立即组织反击。
> KDS

> 的确。我会向我的主人汇报，也会联系科尔局长，在即将发生的事件中尽我们的一份力。
> Rosser

> 每次我都会感到惊讶，我们的主人和女主人要是能直接对话，能够节省多少时间。
> KDS

> 或许吧，但这不是我们能决定的事。我们已向他们效命，我们的职责不是去质疑，而是去执行，并在力所能及的范围内提供协助。
> Rosser.

Present: Kendra de Santos (human, female, voice of great dragon Arleesh), Edwin Rosser (human, male, voice of great dragon Celedyr)

> Thank you for meeting with me on such short notice, Edwin. I understand the inconvenience this must be for you.
> KDS
> Neither rain nor snow, nor threat of universal Armageddon will keep me from facilitating my master’s business. But before we continue, my master wishes your mistress a speedy recovery from her injuries sustained in Motor City. He was most distressed to learn of her current condition as much as he was how it occurred.
> Rosser
> Thank you. As she once told Director Cole, “It seemed like a good idea at the time.” Still, she will be equal parts pleased at your concern and irritated that your master knows of her weakened condition. She has worked extremely hard to keep such information secret, even among her peers.
> KDS
> I understand. But information is, after all, his business. Still, she can trust that my master is the only one among her peers who knows this and will hold that information in the strictest of confidence. Such information would be a destabilizing influence, even among allies. But if any additional medical assistance is required, my master is uniquely qualified to assist.
> Rosser
> Agreed and thank you. But let us stay on topic, the real reason for this meeting. How far along is your project concerning the Disian language?
> KDS
> With the new cypher Transys-Neuronet has created, we’re in the process of translating and decrypting the backlog of old data and transcripts. Unfortunately, we’re working on a backlog of 1.2 giga-pulses of data.
> Rosser
> *audible sigh* I was hoping for better news, but at least we have a start.
> KDS
> I’m afraid I also have worse news to bear. My master prioritized several files he was sure contained vital information, and as it turns out he was correct. The information regards the establishment of the Disian Harvester Network. It seems that the timetable has been accelerated. Where we once may have had years, we now may only have months before it comes online. And once the process starts, we cannot stop it without destroying the material plane. So, we either die or we scorch our own earth.
> Rosser
> *unable to translate, language not recognized* Apologies, I’ve learned some of my mistress’ language. It tends to arise when I’m most angered.
> KDS
> No apologies needed, but I compliment you on getting the accent right. But I have one more necessary bit of critical information. While there is one central network being constructed, the plans we’ve obtained also indicate that several auxiliary networks or at least offshoot branches are also being completed. Much like a Matrix system, should the main networks be taken offline or destroyed, the auxiliary ones will immediately take up the slack.
> Rosser
> Then we obviously have no time to lose. I will inform my mistress and Director Cole at once. We need to form a counteroffensive immediately.
> KDS
> Indeed. I will update my Master and be in touch with Director Cole as well to do our part in the upcoming events.
> Rosser
> It never ceases to amaze me how much time could be saved if our respective masters and mistresses would simply speak directly to each other.
> KDS
> Perhaps, but that is not for us to decide. We pledged our services to them, and it is not for us to question why, but merely to do as we are asked. And do what we can to assist in our own ways.
> Rosser.

> 下午好，Mr. Dowd。虽然我对这次会面的时机颇感好奇。我几乎就在五分钟前准备给您发出邀请，结果一打开收件箱，就先发现了您的来信。
> Ringmaster

> 如果这让您感到不安，那我表示歉意。我并无此意。
> Mr. Dowd

> 无需道歉。我在这行干得够久了，不会因每个古怪的事件或晦涩的讯息就惊讶或不安。我把它们都看作是另一种形式的沟通。说到这个，我干得也够久了，知道什么时候有人在……找不到更好的词，就说是“试镜”吧。
> Ringmaster

> 哦？您觉得我想加入你们的“剧团”？
> Mr. Dowd

> 请吧，Mr. Dowd，我们大可不必像业界同仁那样玩弄那些众所周知的文字游戏。今天不妨直截了当点说。不过为了回应您的问题，是的，我的确如此认为。我知道，最近上任的道金斯集团主管不会无缘无故地做任何事。顺便说一句，恭喜您。
> Ringmaster

> 一语破的，谢谢您。您说得没错。
> Mr. Dowd

> 很高兴听您这么说，不过您也能理解我为什么要问原因。
> Ringmaster

> 当然，如果我是您，我也会这么做。说我们的动机完全是出于无私，这话大致是真的，但也包裹着谎言。世界末日当然令人担忧，但说到底，我的上级们早就厌倦了被人视作“十大”中最弱的那个。迪斯人甚至根本没有主动接触地平线。我们后来得知，他们认为我们不值一提，引用原话就是：“一无可取”。而我们对此感到非常不爽。而且，有机会狠狠恶心一下阿兹特科技，这永远是件好事。
> Mr. Dowd

> 所以地平线是因为没能在末日审判的桌上占有一席之地而恼火了？
> Ringmaster

> 我更喜欢“诸神黄昏”这个说法——北欧诸神更有风格，也更有市场号召力。而且，迪斯人更让我想起尘世巨蛇耶梦加得，而我们的魔力场则像是世界树尤克特拉希尔。
> Mr. Dowd

> 有道理。
> Ringmaster

> 不过在继续之前，容我献上一份小小的和平礼。鉴于迪斯人通过阿兹特科技公司以及其他代理人，靠纯粹的公关手段对你们的部队横行霸道，让我呈上一份我业余时间筹备的东西。我刚发给您的文件应当说明了一切。
> Mr. Dowd

> 嗯，有意思。你这些都是在业余时间做的？
> Ringmaster

> 当然。我喜欢让脑子忙着——我从来就不适合睡觉。
> Mr. Dowd

> 的确如此。“计划：弗洛基”？这名字也太直白了点吧？
> Ringmaster

> 我说过了，北欧神话确实有一套风格。但这个计划不仅能帮你们争取一点喘息空间，还能摇动象征性的“果树”，让我们收获其果实。
> Mr. Dowd

> 听起来倒更像犹太—基督教传统，不过我觉得我们可以合作一下。
> Ringmaster

> 听您这么说我真是太高兴了，先生。
> Mr. Dowd

> Good afternoon, Mr. Dowd. Although I am somewhat curious about the timing of this meeting. I was quite literally five minutes from sending you an invitation to talk and yet, what do I see in my inbox?
> Ringmaster
> Apologies if that unnerved you in any way. That was not my intention.
> Mr. Dowd
> None are necessary. I’ve been in the game long enough to not be surprised or unnerved over every odd occurrence or cryptic message that finds its way to me. I see them all as simply another form of communication. Speaking of, I’ve also been in long enough to know when someone is, for the lack of a better term, auditioning.
> Ringmaster
> Oh? You think I want to be a part of your little production?
> Mr. Dowd
> Please, Mr. Dowd, we don’t need to engage in the typical wordplay those of our profession are so well known for. Let’s for once speak plainly. But to answer your question, yes, I do. I know that the recently installed head of the Dawkins Group doesn’t do anything without reason. Congratulations on that, by the way.
> Ringmaster
> Touché, and thank you. And you are correct.
> Mr. Dowd
> I’m glad to hear that, but you’ll understand if I ask why.
> Ringmaster
> Of course, I would do the same in your position. To say that our reasoning is purely altruistic would be mostly true but wrapped in a lie. The end of the world is certainly concerning, but at the end of the day my superiors are sick of being thought of as “the weakest” of the Big Ten. Horizon wasn’t even approached by the Disians. We’ve since learned that they consider us beneath them, with, and I quote, “nothing to offer.” And as the old saying goes, we took that personally. That, and a chance to stick it to Aztechnology is never a bad thing.
> Mr. Dowd
> So Horizon is upset at not having a seat at the table of Armageddon?
> Ringmaster
> I prefer Ragnarök—the Norse Gods have a certain style, and they’re more marketable. Also, the Disians remind me more of Jormungand with our own manasphere being Yggdrasil.
> Mr. Dowd
> Point taken.
> Ringmaster
> But before we go any further, allow me to make a small peace offering. Given the how the Disians through Aztechnology and others are running roughshod on your forces through sheer PR, let me present you with something I’ve been working on in my spare time. The file I just sent you should say it all.
> Mr. Dowd
> Hmm. Interesting. All this on your free time?
> Ringmaster
> Of course. I prefer to keep my mind occupied—sleep never suited me anyway.
> Mr. Dowd
> Indeed. Project: Floki? Bit on the nose, isn’t it?
> Ringmaster
> Like I said, the Norse have a certain style. But this plan should not only help give your people some breathing room but shake the proverbial trees allowing us to gather the fruit.
> Mr. Dowd
> Sounds a bit more Judeo-Christian, but I think it’s something we can work with.
> Ringmaster
> It pleases me to no end to hear you say that, good sir.
> Mr. Dowd

> 看起来该到的人都到了。有些人选择不出席，这让我感到遗憾。但好吧。对在座的各位，我要说感谢你们的到来。我非常希望这只是一次欢迎会，但我想大家都非常清楚当下的局势，也清楚这其中的利害关系。
> Ringmaster

> 抱歉，我怀疑我们谁也称不上“非常清楚”局势。我不代表别人发言，但我可以肯定地说，我们来这里是为了对整体局势有个更清晰的认识。
> KaKingAres

> 我们中有些人确实比其他人更清楚局势，或者说，我们一直在关注。而你嘛，考虑到底特律的那场闹剧，考虑到你们CEO真正效忠的对象，我们也可以理解你为什么有点落后。
> Buttercup

> 我觉得这话不太公平。
> KDS

> 或许吧，也或许不是。虽然我不像来自Evo的那位代表说话那么……直接，我还是要提出个问题：为什么阿瑞斯会被允许参与这场会议？到目前为止，他们至少表现出亲迪斯的倾向。
> Mr. Dowd

> 我想我们今天都会谈到一些可能存在利益冲突的因素，这些也不是什么秘密。只要稍加留心就能看出，总部早已偏离了我们的最初使命与目标。而阿瑞斯西雅图是我的辖区，我们已经在对抗泛位面威胁的前线奋战了三十多年。不管你们对其他企业有什么看法，我认为安全就是阿瑞斯对历史最大的贡献，而阿瑞斯西雅图将继续坚持这一信条。
> KaKingAres

> 那么毫无疑问，你可以为我们这些人解释一下阿瑞斯的计划了。
> GhostOps001

> 我之前说得很清楚，阿瑞斯西雅图并没有追随总部的路线。总部比谁都清楚这一点。他们了解我的履历，也知道我的立场。我已经被彻底排除在那些决策圈之外了。
> KaKingAres

> 那我就不明白你来这里能带来什么了。
> GhostOps001

> 阿瑞斯西雅图。看火人部队。武器生产。战术分析。而且即便我被排除在讨论之外，也不代表我缺乏见解。我来这里不仅是为了提供支援力量，更是为了找到那些缺失的拼图，为我们大家描绘出更清晰的全貌。
> KaKingAres

> 看来我们都处在同一起跑线上了。感谢你的坦率，金女士。
> Red Blade

> 随你怎么说。
> Buttercup

> 如果我们不打算继续质疑彼此的贡献，或者有没有资格坐在这张桌边，那我们是不是该继续了？还是有人还需要比一比自己有多大……贡献？
> Ringmaster

> 那幸福呢？他们有人正在积极协助迪斯人，这我亲眼所见。我可以接受金的解释与立场，但我对“死亡女士”的出席还有些存疑。
> The Collector

> 这个问题很复杂。确实，幸福内部确实有一些派系在积极协助迪斯，但还有更多的部门对此一无所知。我本人也是最近才得知情况。因此，我已经开始采取行动，试图抵消和瓦解迪斯的影响力。当然这很复杂。但我此刻是在完全自主的前提下出席，并提供我个人的协助与资源，其中一部分也来自幸福内部。
> Lady Death

> 我们讨论这一话题够了吗？能不能继续？
> Ringmaster

> 请便。我刚才只差一瞬就准备离开这场看似闹剧的会议了。毕竟我还有更重要、更有成效的事务要处理。
> Script Diver

> 感谢你的耐心，尊贵之人。也感谢在座各位。出于尊重，我将省去我们这一类存在通常在你们这一类之间表现出的那些礼节与规范。现在不是分裂的时候，而是团结的时候，因为迪斯的威胁不仅是对泛人类的威胁，更是对一切居于物质界众生的威胁。正因如此，在座诸位都是经特别邀请而来，因为你们都具备某种价值。如果你没有，那你就不会在这里。现在，为了回应我们所面临的威胁，并回应金女士提出的“更清晰认知”的诉求，我将把话语权交给我值得信赖的得力助手。
> KDS

> “我们这一类”？
> GhostOps001

> 她的主子正在通过她说话。
> Script Diver

> 谢谢你，菲罗兹女士。为了不浪费大家的时间，我就开门见山了。迪斯人正在展开反击，而且攻势凌厉。反抗他们的力量虽然英勇奋战，但却四散无序。在数个关键地点，反抗者已被迪斯部队压制并逐一击破。我们其余的人正在尽己所能提供支援，但我们自己也正受到攻击，兵力捉襟见肘，防线岌岌可危。同时，我们掌握的情报表明，迪斯方面已经下达了一个代号为“最终计划”的执行命令。鉴于我们已知的关于他们终极目标的信息，我想可以肯定地说：迪斯人已经启动了他们的终极计划。为了阻止这一切，我们需要尽快组建一个更统一的阵线，来协调各方力量，整合资源与情报。我们必须现在就开始行动。
> Ringmaster

> 我想我们可以放心地假设，在座的每一位都愿意支持这一点。
> Silk

> 毕竟，为了生存而战，是最容易获得支持的，不是吗？
> Buttercup

> 那么，具体而言，你们要我们做什么？如果这只是一种形式，为了让大家同意进行战术上的协调合作，那么唯一真正的问题就是：谁来指挥？抛开个人意志不谈，考虑到阿勒什与灰细胞多年来一直冲锋在前，让他们来领导似乎是最自然的选择。
> Silk

> 毫不意外，一个曾经听命于巨龙的人，如今又这般乐于俯首听命。
> GhostOps001

> 不要自欺欺人。每一个有影响力的组织，都曾经或正在被他们所触及。在为我们这个世界的存亡而战时，没有责任的划分可言。但我的主人们不会轻易同意这样的指挥架构。
> Red Blade

> 为什么不呢？我们只是在统治世界这件事上，表现得格外出色。
> Script Diver

> 拜托。你连和你的同类们一样多的宝藏都没有，怎么配得上这么有权威地说话？或者，称作“有资格”会更合适？
> The Collector

> 说到争议点，我觉得亚特兰蒂斯基金会的代表不该谈“配得上”，毕竟你们自己最近的状况呢？你们有多少分会被突袭？你们多少人被迫流散？这些年来你们辛辛苦苦觊觎并收藏的珍贵文物，有多少突然落入敌手？
> GhostOps001

> 这不关你的事。
> The Collector

> 恰恰相反，这事关系重大。敌人，我相信迪斯人就是这么被称呼的，在几乎所有方面都占据优势。人数、后勤、战略布局……我可以继续说下去。
> GhostOps001

> 然而，是你提出了“我们能带来什么”的问题。一个破碎国家的残缺情报机构能带来什么？
> Red Blade

> 你这么说真有意思。随你怎么说UCAS，但至少我们对自己的失败是诚实的。我们国家的现状，是因为我们选择了对抗联络乐意参与的巨型企业体系；一个迪斯人轻易渗透，甚至在有些场合被热烈欢迎加入的体系。如果我们赢了，联络的计划是什么？吹嘘他们的胜利，就像阿兹特科技对亚马逊所做的那样，好在股市上赚到几个点？
> GhostOps001

> 你竟敢说出这样的话，要么极其勇敢，要么就是愚蠢。出于合作精神，也考虑到眼前的威胁，我不会把这些话转告我的主人，他们肯定不会喜欢有人质疑他们的集体荣誉。
> Red Blade

> 别来这套义愤填膺或就什么“荣誉”大谈特谈。但在我被红武士或者一群暗影狂奔者拜访之前，我告诉你，我这个“残缺”的机构拥有什么：大量秘密，大批训练有素、动力十足，更重要的是地位很高的关键人物，他们只是在寻找一个方向。我知道前任局长科尔（别以为我忘了你抛弃祖国的事）收留了他们中的许多人，但外面还有更多无所畏惧、无所顾忌的人。
> GhostOps001

> 没必要再提过去了，肯特。事情已经发生，我们该关注的是未来。如果我不认为你和CIA其他人有贡献的价值，我根本不会邀请你来。
> Ringmaster

> 我可去你的吧，特别是你。你“诈死”的时候，把很多人都撂在风口浪尖上，就因为你不认同某些政策？去你的。你根本不知道你那些行为带来了什么后果。我来这里的唯一原因是，我还想为拯救这个该死的星球做点什么。可如果这一切只是旧调重弹的狗屁，那我和我的人立刻就走。要是我们不过是你们手里的棋子，那你们都可以滚蛋了。
> GhostOps001

> 听起来有人肩膀上扛着一个超大的包袱。你打算借着这情绪转投新无政府主义了吗？因为那可是2050年的老黄历啦。
> Buttercup

> 居然还有人说我自负。
> The Collector

> 够了！迪斯人正是靠我们的分裂为食。当侵略者被击退之后，你们尽可以回头去继续拆东墙补西墙，把这个你们根本不懂得去珍惜的世界撕成碎片。但在那之前，请你们牢记，我们每一个人的利益此刻都紧密相连。
> KDS

> 我同意。我们在座的所有人，以及其他许多没有出席会议的人，都应为未能及时发现威胁并早做应对而感到羞愧和自责。为了充分透明，我得承认我所代表的企业起初也把与迪斯人合作视作一个难以拒绝的机遇。我们曾认为与他们结盟能提升我们的资本与影响力——结果却被……无视了。最初，我们认为这是一种侮辱，但随着更多情报的浮现，我们意识到我们所面临的威胁远比单纯的利润率要严重得多。我之所以公开承认这一切，是希望我们能坦诚以对，齐心协力，拯救我们所有人。
> Mr. Dowd

> 虽然我不想承认，但天演当时的处境也差不多。不过我得说，我会抓住这个机会尽可能地让迪斯人吃尽苦头——而且我会非常非常享受这个过程。
> Buttercup

> > 如您所愿，Buttercup。还有，谢谢你，Mr. Dowd。至于伯勒斯先生，不会有任何人在这场行动中沦为棋子。我要对在场所有人说一句：这不是权力之争，这是关乎生存的问题。我们必须开始以这样的心态来行动，整合我们的资源以确保我们自身的生存。好了——还有谁想发言，想把心里话都说出来，好让我们能回到正题上？
> KDS

> 好吧，那我们加入。但我会记住你刚才说的话。
> GhostOps001

> 虽然我不想像全息影片那样在最戏剧化的时刻出现，但我确实有一些与当前讨论密切相关的重要情报需要分享。我的分析人员刚刚完成了几段由数名浮士德发出的通信解密，内容是来自他们迪斯主人的命令。他们的“最终计划”——也就是“收割机网络”的建构——已经加快进程。在他们计划启动该网络之前，我们只剩下大约六个月的时间。更糟糕的是，他们准备使用“激进”手段，在网络启动后的数小时内将物质界的魔力如同露天采矿般强行剥离。这将引发一场前所未有的法力紊乱。
> Script Diver

> 有多糟？
> KaKingAres

> 根据我们的预测，一旦收割完成，地球上将有40%到60%的区域被直接摧毁。剩余的部分将在两到三个月内经历缓慢死亡。所有魔法都将消失，而所有生命也将在不久后相继凋亡。
> Script Diver

> 那问题来了：到底发生了什么？我记得迪斯人原本是想尽可能保留魔力，好以最大的潜能和效率进行采集。
> The Collector

> 出于透明原则，我会回答这个问题。
> KDS

> 女士……不，请不要说。
> Ringmaster

> 这件事必须说清楚。大约两年前，在阿瑞斯高塔的战斗中，达米安·奈特疯狂地打算将他手头的迪斯装置改造成简易末日武器。一共八台。当战局对他不利时，他取消了装置的所有安全协议。虽然他最终被阻止，但那八台装置还是被激活了。在一瞬间的绝望疯狂中，我们打开了物质界与迪斯泛位面之间的通道。然后，我用我所有的魔法力量，将那些破坏性能量导向了那个泛位面。我本想尽可能多地造成破坏，考虑到阿瑞斯装置的工作原理，这也许还能为我们争取一些时间。但结果却是加速了他们那个位面魔力的衰竭速率，逼得迪斯人走投无路，使他们加快了在物质界的计划。我本希望此举能终结或至少延缓迪斯的威胁，但却让情况变得更糟。我也因此受到了魔法上的伤害。而我也不知道该如何解释这点。这就是我为何从那之后再未公开露面、亲自出面抗敌，而是一直依靠我信任的特工行事。我现在在你们所有人面前将这些全盘托出，是为了让我们能正面处理这件事，而不是让它在关键时刻引发分裂。
> KDS

> 我……我不知道该怎么回应。
> The Collector

> 这信息太沉重了。我同意这的确非常鲁莽，但有时候我们没有时间反思，也没有后见之明。我们只能当机立断，不论后果是好是坏。
> Red Blade

> 你看到了机会，就出手了。结果却事与愿违。换做是我，我也会做出同样的选择。
> KaKingAres

> 这并不能改变当前的处境。但也许未来会有人清算这事。先处理眼前的危机吧。
> Silk

> 嘁。你让他们吃了苦头，这我就满意了。
> Buttercup

> 这更说明我们接下来需要更好的协调机制。
> Mr. Dowd

> 确实。既然这件事也已澄清，同时我们也得知了这些令人清醒的消息，那我现在要把讨论拉回这场会议的原点，顺便回应一下Silk的问题。协调确实需要一定的指挥层级，但我认为我们可以借此机会展开情报交流——最好是绕过那些不断延误的密道和验证机制。时间不站在我们这边，要赢这一局，我们需要速度和彼此信任来赢得这场胜利。
> Ringmaster

> 还有不少的火力支持。
> Red Blade

> 毫无疑问。
> GhostOps001

> 那我建议我们现在就趁机建立一个“战争议会”。然后，我们通知各自的上级，并在24小时内重新召开会议，至少商讨出一套基本可行的协作机制。
> Lady Death

> 我的主人们或许会犹豫，但我已经被授权可以代表他们全权处理此事。
> Red Blade

> 我还希望确保有黑结社的代表参与——哪怕只是为了盯着他们——但我同意。
> Silk

> 黑结社怎么没派人来？
> GhostOps001

> 就像很多事情一样，这个问题……很复杂。但我会发出邀请。除此之外，我不反对Lady Death的提议。有没有人在最后一刻还有信息或问题要提？
> Ringmaster

> 那我就把大家的沉默当作“没有”。很好，那么我们将在24小时后再次集结。欢迎来到这场战争，各位。
> Ringmaster

> It looks like everyone who will be here is here. Some have elected not to show, which saddens me. But very well. To everyone in attendance, I want to say thank you for your presence. I wish I could say this was a welcome meeting, but I think that everyone here is keenly aware of the circumstances, as well as the stakes.
> Ringmaster
> Forgive me, but I doubt any of us are fully aware of the circumstances, let alone keenly. I don’t speak for anyone but myself, but I feel safe saying we all came here looking for a better handle on the picture as a whole.
> KaKingAres
> Some of us are more keenly aware of the situation, or rather we’ve been paying attention. But then, after the fiasco in Detroit, I guess we can understand if you’re a little behind, considering what allegiances your CEO really has.
> Buttercup
> I don’t think that’s quite fair.
> KDS
> Maybe, maybe not. And while not as … blunt as the representative from Evo, I must raise the question of why Ares is being represented in this meeting? Thus far they have been shown to be at the very least Disian-leaning.
> Mr. Dowd
> I imagine we’re all going to talk about potentially compromising elements here, and it’s not really a secret for anyone who has been paying attention. The home office has drifted from our original mandates and mission parameters. Ares Seattle is my territory. We’ve been on the frontlines fighting extradimensional threats for over thirty years. Say whatever you like about other corporate interests, but as far as I’m concerned, security is Ares’ greatest contribution to history, and Ares Seattle will continue to follow that priority.
> KaKingAres
> Then doubtless you can shed some light on Ares’ plans for the rest of us.
> GhostOps001
> I think I was clear that Ares Seattle isn’t toeing the line. The head office can see that better than anyone. They know my record and they know my politics. I’m effectively cut out of those discussions.
> KaKingAres
> Not really sure what you’re bringing to the table, then.
> GhostOps001
> Ares Seattle. Firewatch Teams. Weapons production. Tactical analysis. And just because I was cut out of the discussion doesn’t mean I lack insights. I’m not just here with forces to contribute. I’m looking for missing pieces of the puzzle, to put context to what I hear and form a better final picture for us all.
> KaKingAres
> It seems that puts us all on equal footing. I appreciate your candor, Ms. King.
> Red Blade
> As you like.
> Buttercup
> Unless we want to question anyone else’s contributions, or right to sit at this table, shall we proceed? Or does anyone else need to compare how big their … contributions are?
> Ringmaster
> What about Shiawase? They’ve got people actively helping the Dis, I’ve seen the proof myself. I can buy King’s explanation and position, but I’m unsure about Lady Death’s presence.
> The Collector
> That answer is complicated. While there have been divisions within Shiawase that have been actively assisting the Dis, there are several more that have no idea what is going on. I myself was only recently made aware. As such, I’ve begun my own efforts to counteract and undo Disian influence. But it is complicated. I am, however, here of my own accord offering my personal assistance and assets; some of which are from within Shiawase.
> Lady Death
> Are we done with this line of discussion? Can we move on?
> Ringmaster
> Please, by all means. I was a mere two heartbeats away from exiting what appeared to be a farce of a meeting. I have better, more productive matters to attend to after all.
> Script Diver
> I thank you for your patience here, honored one. And to the rest of you as well. Out of respect, I will dispense with the normal protocols and standards of behavior that those of my kind tend to visit upon your kind. This is not a time for division, this is a time for unity as the Disian threat is a threat not just to metahumanity but to all who reside on the material plane. To that end, those who are here today were invited specifically because they bring something to the table. If you did not, you simply wouldn’t be here. Now, to address the threat we face, and to get a better handle on things as Ms. King inquired, I give the floor to my trusted right hand.
> KDS
> “My kind”?
> GhostOps001
> Her mistress is speaking through her.
> Script Diver
> Thank you, Señora Feroz. To not further waste anyone’s time, let me come right to it. The Disians are on the move and striking back hard. Those in opposition to them, while fighting valiantly, are scattered and disorganized. In several key locations, they’re being overwhelmed and picked off piecemeal by Disian forces. The rest of us are doing our best to lend aid and support, but we’re also under attack and stretched dangerously thin. Additionally, we have intelligence that indicates the go-ahead order has been given for something the Disians are calling “The Final Project.” Given what we know about their ultimate goal, I think it’s safe to say that the Disians have initiated their endgame. To prevent this, we need to form a more unified front to coordinate our efforts and share resources and intelligence. And we need to do it now.
> Ringmaster
> I think we can safely assume everyone here is on board for that.
> Silk
> Well, existence is an easy cause to back, isn’t it?
> Buttercup
> What, precisely, do you want us to do? If this is simply a formality to get everyone to sign on for coordinated tactical engagements, then the only real question is who is calling the shots. Putting egos aside, it seems natural for Arleesh and Grey Cell to do so given how long they have been the tip of the spear.
> Silk
> What a surprise that someone who once took orders from a dragon is so willing to bow to them, again.
> GhostOps001
> Don’t lie to yourself. Every organization of consequence is—or in some cases was—touched by them. And there is no division of responsibility in a fight for the existence of our world. But my masters will not easily agree to such a command structure.
> Red Blade
> Why not? We’re just so very good at ruling the world.
> Script Diver
> Please. Your inability to lay claim to as many treasures as your peers barely makes you qualified to speak with such authority. Or is worthy a better term?
> The Collector
> As a point of contention, I think that the representative of the Atlantean Foundation should not talk about “worthiness” considering their own current events. How many of your chapter houses have been raided? How many of your people have been scattered? How many of those precious artifacts you’ve managed to covet and collect for these past decades have suddenly ended up in the hands of the enemy?
> GhostOps001
> That is none of your concern.
> The Collector
> On the contrary, it very much is. The Enemy, as I believe the Disians are being called, has a significant advantage in almost every category. Numbers, logistics, strategic positioning … I could go on.
> GhostOps001
> Yet you were the one who brought up the question of what is being brought to this table. What does the gutted intelligence agency of a shattered nation bring?
> Red Blade
> Interesting you bring that up. Say what you want about the UCAS, but at least we’re honest with our frag-ups. And my country’s current situation is due to the fact that we decided to stand up to the megacorporate system that Renraku is a willing part of; a system that the Disians so easily infiltrated and in some cases was welcomed into with open arms. And what are Renraku’s plans if we win, huh? Tout their victories just like Aztechnology did with Amazonia to gain a few points on the stock markets?
> GhostOps001
> You are either extremely brave or foolish to speak such things. In the spirit of cooperation and with regard to the current threat, I will not relay them to my masters, who would most assuredly not take kindly to their collective honor being questioned.
> Red Blade
> Please spare me any righteous indignation or talk of “honor.” But before I get a visit from any Red Samurai or any number of shadowrunners, I’ll tell you what my “gutted” agency has: a lot of secrets and a lot of highly trained, highly motivated, and most importantly highly placed people just looking for a direction. I know former-Director Cole (and don’t think I forgot about your abandonment of your country) took many of them into his fold, but there are still significantly more out there who’ve got nothing left to lose.
> GhostOps001
> There is no need to bring up the past, Kent. What’s done is done; we need to focus on the future. I wouldn’t have invited you if I didn’t think you and the rest of the CIA didn’t have anything to contribute.
> Ringmaster
> You most of all can go frag yourself. You hung a lot of people out to dry when you “died,” all because you didn’t agree with policy? Frag you again. You have no idea what the fallout of your actions caused. The only reason I’m here is because I want to contribute something to save my damn planet. But if all this going to be nothing more than the same old bulldrek, then my people and I are out. If we’re going to be nothing more than pawns to you people, then you all can go frag off.
> GhostOps001
> Sounds like someone has a massive chip on their shoulder. You plan on going neo-anarchist with those sentiments? Because that was soooo 2050s.
> Buttercup
> And people say I have an ego.
> The Collector
> Enough! The Disians feed on our division. You may return to your petty piecemealing of the world you fail to appreciate when the invaders are repelled. Until then, consider each of our interests intimately intertwined.
> KDS
> I concur. All of us here, as well as many others not in attendance, share just as much blame and the associated shame for first not detecting the threat and acting sooner. For full transparency on my corporation’s part, we originally considered the opportunity with the Disians something too good to pass up. We considered an alliance with them something that would raise our capital and clout, only to be … ignored. At first, we considered that an insult, but as more information came to light, we realized the threat we face was much greater than mere profit margins. I say this for complete transparency, in hopes that we all may be able to move forward and save our collective hoops.
> Mr. Dowd
> As much as I hate to agree, Evo was in a similar position. However, I will admit that I will be taking this opportunity to make the Disians suffer in any way I can and taking as much personal pleasure as I can from that.
> Buttercup
> As you wish, Buttercup. And thank you, Mr. Dowd. And to Mr. Burroughs, no one will be pawns in this. And I say this to everyone assembled here: This is not about power; it is about survival. We need to start acting as if that’s the case by pooling our collective resources to ensure our very survival. Now—does anyone else have anything they wish to say, to get anything off their chests as it were, so that we can get back to the task at hand?
> KDS
> Okay, then, we’re in. But I’ll hold you to that statement.
> GhostOps001
> Not to seem like a trid show and come in at the most dramatic moment, but I have pertinent information to share that may have some bearing on the current conversation. My analysts have just finished decrypting several communications from several Faustians regarding instructions from the Disian masters. The timetable on their Final Project, the establishment of the Harvester Network, has been stepped up. We now only have approximately six months left before they plan to activate it. Worse yet, they’re planning on using “radical” methods akin to strip-mining the material plane’s mana in mere hours once the network becomes active. This will create mana disturbances the likes of which no age has seen before.
> Script Diver
> How bad?
> KaKingAres
> Our projections say that once the harvest is complete, between forty to sixty percent of the planet will be destroyed outright. The rest will die a slow death between two to three months after. All magic will be gone, and all life will slowly die soon after.
> Script Diver
> This begs the question: what happened? I thought the Disians wanted to preserve our mana as much as possible so they could harvest it at maximum potential and potency.
> The Collector
> In the spirit of transparency, I will answer that.
> KDS
> Señora … no, please.
> Ringmaster
> It needs to be said. During the battle at Ares Tower almost two years ago, Damien Knight in a fit of madness intended to use his version of the Disian Devices as an improvised doomsday weapon. Eight in total. He removed the Devices’ safety protocols once it looked like the battle would go against him. He was eventually stopped but not before they were activated. In a flash of desperate insanity, we were able to create an opening between the material plane and the Disian metaplane. I then used all my magical strength to channel those destructive energies into that plane. I had intended to cause as much damage as possible, maybe even buy us some time considering the nature of how Ares’ Devices worked. But instead, I only increased their metaplane’s rate of mana decay, forcing Dis into a corner and causing them to accelerate their plans for the material plane. In a move I had hoped could end or at least delay the Disian threat, I only made it worse. It also injured me, magically. I don’t know how else to explain that. That is why I haven’t been seen in public and been relying on my trusted agents rather than confronting the threat directly. I tell all of you this now, putting all cards on the table, so that it can be dealt with rather than potentially fracture us at a critical time.
> KDS
> Well, I don’t know what to say about that.
> The Collector
> This is a lot to consider. I agree it was most reckless, but sometimes we don’t have the luxury of time and hindsight. We must act in the moment, for better or worse.
> Red Blade
> You saw the shot, you took it. Didn’t work out the way you hoped. I’d have done the same.
> KaKingAres
> It changes nothing within the current situation. However, there may be a reckoning later. But one crisis at a time.
> Silk
> Meh. You made them suffer, I’m good with that.
> Buttercup
> This just reinforces the need for better coordination moving forward.
> Mr. Dowd
> Indeed. And with that out of the way as well as facing that sobering news, I now bring us back to the original point of this meeting. And the answer to Silk’s question. Yes, coordination will require a degree of hierarchy, but I believe this is a chance to exchange intelligence, preferably without the delay of backchannels and verification. Time is not on our side, and it’s going to take speed and trust to win this.
> Ringmaster
> And no small degree of firepower.
> Red Blade
> No drek.
> GhostOps001
> I will suggest then that we take the opportunity to form a war council right here and now. Then we inform our respective superiors and reconvene within twenty-four hours to work out at least a functional methodology of working together.
> Lady Death
> My masters will be hesitant, but I have been given full authority to act on their behalf in this endeavor.
> Red Blade
> I would also like to make sure we have a representative from the Black Lodge, if for no other reason than to keep an eye on them, but I agree.
> Silk
> Why isn’t the Lodge represented here?
> GhostOps001
> Like many things, the answer to that is complicated. But I will extend the invitation. Other than that, I have no objections to Lady Death’s proposal. Does anyone have last-minute details or issues they wish to bring forth?
> Ringmaster
> I will take your collective silences that there are not. Very well, we shall reconvene in twenty-four hours. Welcome to the war, everyone.
> Ringmaster
