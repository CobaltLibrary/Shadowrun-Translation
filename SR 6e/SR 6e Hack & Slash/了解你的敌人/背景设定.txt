“神”总是注视着我们。在过去，这句谚语被用来灌输恐惧给顽皮的孩子，并以神圣审判的威胁来震慑潜在的罪犯。然而现在，在当今的矩阵中，这句话变得更加真实。GOD，或者说“网域监察部门”，已经成为了一个当之无愧的可怕恶魔，一双隐藏在黑暗中注视着我们的看不见的眼睛。我们必须比以往任何时候都更加小心，才能避开GOD那炽烈的目光。

GOD is always watching. In times past, that aphorism was used to instill fear in naughty children and deter would-be criminals with the promise of divine judgment. Yet now, in the Matrix of today, this becomes all the more true. GOD, or the Grid Overwatch Division, hath become a rightly feared bogeyman, the unseen eyes watching from the darkness. We must be more careful than ever before, if we are to avoid GOD’s burning gaze.

合围是一种令人畏惧的可怕现象。我们所有人都有过那种感觉。就好像有人在你的身后窥视。下个漏洞会是个大家伙。最后一个。轻轻一抖手腕，你的化身摆出一个神秘的姿势，一切就都结束了。你被合围了，“神”已经来了，他怒火冲天地前来施行报复，魔鬼随行于他的身侧，脚踏地狱烈火而来。过时的警车在你身边以不可能的急刹车停下，穿着沉闷西装的人们从中出现，他们手里拿着一个世纪前的自动步枪。你被合围了。你没有地方可去，即使想弹出也来不及了。你无路可逃。

没有命令。没有警告，也没有宽恕。他们开枪了，在几分之一秒的时间里，整个世界变成一片黑暗，而你的化身被彻底撕碎。没有任何防御或诡计可以保护你。你的碟板化为一团燃烧的闪耀余烬，而这冰冷、沉闷的现实有如重锤一击，让你重新聚焦于当下。眉心被锯齿刀片刺穿般的疼痛在你的眼底爆发。你的思绪开始凝聚在所发生的一切上，逃跑的念头浮现在你脑海中。他们知道你在哪里，并且每一秒都在收紧绞索。

Convergence is a rightly feared phenomenon. All of us have had that feeling. As if one is staring over thine shoulder. That this next exploit will be the big one. The final one. One flick of the wrist, one arcane gesture from thy persona, and it is over. Thou art surrounded. GOD has come, raging for revenge, with the devil by his side, come hot from hell. Antique police cars screech to a halt impossibly around thee, and men in drab suits emerge, carrying automatic rifles from a century ago. Thou art surrounded. There is nowhere to go, and it is too late to jack out. There is no escape.

No order is given. No warning or quarter is offered. The men open fire, and in fractions of a second all is black, thy persona is shredded. There are no defenses or tricks left to protect thee. Thy deck is reduced to a smoldering pile of glittering ash, and this cold, dull reality slams back into focus as a hammerblow. Pain as a jagged knife piercing the brow erupts behind thine eyes. Thoughts begin to coalesce on what happened, and the singular thought of escape enters thy mind. They know where thou art and are tightening the noose by the second.

> And that’s enough for pure authenticity. As most of you know, Dodger has a certain flair for the dramatic when it comes to how he tends to communicate. In order to maintain any semblance of clarity, I had an agent go through and clean up the rest of the entry to be more in tune with the clientele here at the ’Point. It may not grab every “thee” and “thou,” but I think it did a decent job.

这只是每天在矩阵内上演的众多场景之一，一位在不太受欢迎的地方制造了太多噪音而陷入困境的碟客的悲惨故事。自从企业法庭矩阵监管局将直接执法权交给GOD以来，这就成为了矩阵的故事。自那时起，我们被迫在我们的工作中更加小心谨慎，因为现在希望我们灭亡的不仅仅是IC。

我觉得有必要对我的行为表示歉意。我确实向许多实体提供了服务以换取对特定数据档案的访问权，而这些实体通常是对我们的行业有敌意的。这些档案中包含了许多崩溃前的记录，以及2064年新星首次公开募股后发生的灾难性事件的相关信息。我发现这些碎片很有用，因为它们使我更接近找回我失去的、但我知道仍然存在的东西。诚然，我在寻找我的“女士”，每一天都让我更接近她。她在结构层中呼唤着我，我将在那里找到她。然而，这并非没有风险。结构层中隐藏着许多来自矩阵古老时代的阴影。在找到我的“女士”的所在，我也将发现谎言之树的踪迹。

> 结构层？所以他是说那就是他一直要找的地方？以前的矩阵里存在结构层吗？

> Sunshine

> 深层共鸣一直是矩阵中的一股力量，甚至在64年崩溃前就已经存在。许多宅客，或称“矩阵之子”，响应了它的呼唤，甚至早在2050年代就出现了。不幸的是，当时一个AI冒充了深层共鸣的呼唤，聚集了许多人来支持它，试图以此挣脱其虚拟监狱的束缚。Dodger所说的“女士”是一个站在它对立面的AI。

> Netcat

> 一个AI？你意思是一个AI可以冒充共鸣本身？

> Sunshine

> 不只是普通的AI。上一代矩阵中的AI具有令人恐惧的强大能力，它们几乎可以为所欲为，包括用虚假的共鸣副本制造宅客。我们今天看到的AI是有意识的存在，但就其原始力量相比较而言，他们只是64年前的AI的影子。

> Netcat

> 等等，如果Dodger的“女士”是被困在结构层里的AI，那岂不是意味着其他AI也可能在下面？

> Sunshine

> 那就是“谎言之树”，它自称为“Deus”，在矩阵中通常化身为一棵白色的水晶巨树。

This is just one of many scenarios played out every day upon the Matrix. A mournful tale of a decker caught in over their head, making too much noise in a place where such noise was less than welcome. This has been the story of the Matrix since the Corporate Court Matrix Authority gave direct enforcement over to GOD. Ever since, we are forced to be quite a bit more wary in our dealings, as there is more that wishes our demise now than simply IC.

I feel the need to say my peace regarding my actions. ’Tis true I offered my services to many entities, who are often adversarial to our profession, in exchange for access to specific data archives. These archives contain many a pre-Crash record and bits of information surrounding the happenings that followed the disastrous Novatech IPO in 2064. I find these fragments useful, as they bring me closer to finding that which I lost, but I know still remains. Verily, I search for mine Lady Fair, and each day brings me closer. She calls to me from the Foundation, and I will find her there. It is not without risk, though. The Foundation carries within it many a shadow from the elder days of the Matrix. Where I shall find my Lady Fair, I shall surely find traces of the Tree of Lies, among others.

> The Foundation? So he’s saying that’s where he needed to look all along? Was the Foundation even a thing in the old Matrix?

> Sunshine

> The Deep Resonance has always been a force in the Matrix, even prior to the Crash of ’64. Many of the Otaku, or “Children of the Matrix,” followed its call, even showing up as early as the 2050s. Unfortunately, its call was impersonated by an AI at the time, who gathered many to its side in an attempt to break free of its virtual prison. Dodger’s “Lady Fair” was an AI that stood in opposition.

> Netcat

> An AI? You mean an AI can impersonate the Resonance itself?

> Sunshine

> Not just any AI. The AIs from the previous Matrix were terrifyingly powerful and capable of just about anything they wanted, including creating otaku with a false copy of Resonance. The AIs we see today are sentient beings, but in terms of raw power, they are a shadow of what the AIs were pre ’64.

> Netcat

> Wait, so if Dodger’s “Lady Fair” is an AI trapped in the Foundation, wouldn’t that mean other AIs may be down there too?

> Sunshine

> That’s the “Tree of Lies.” It called itself “Deus,” and while in the Matrix it often took the form of a white crystalline tree.

要知道，虽然我提供了服务，但我的服务仅限于咨询性质。我仔细分析了代码，审查了流程，并在GOD的实施过程中提供了指导。是的，这些服务导致了安保的加强，但这并非没有考虑到我亲爱的同僚们所在的社区。作为我咨询的回报，我不仅获得了对某些数据库的访问权限，还为GOD的基础设施做出了贡献。可以说，只要你知道在哪里寻找，就能在GOD控制的高墙巨垒上找到缝隙。这些缝隙很小，但它们为绕过GOD的监视提供了途径。限制使得这些缝隙必须很小，这样才能躲过那些在GOD的疆界内工作的人的注意。

毫无疑问，公司法庭矩阵监管局和丹妮尔·德·拉·马尔女士拥有管理像GOD这样的组织所需的必要资源和专业知识。但他们是否有从零开始建立这样一个系统所需的能力呢？呈现在我面前的是一个简单、高效但可预测的，典型的企业结构。因此，它有着许多企业结构中常见的缺陷，即可预测性。正是在这种可预测性的基础上，我创造出了下文所述的一些漏洞和方法，以帮助保护你们免受GOD的监视。我被赋予了一项使命，尽管有传言称我已经忘记了自己的出身，但我并没有忘记。

The price of my consultation not only extends to my access to certain databases, it also includes certain additions to the infrastructure of GOD. Cracks in the 162 monolithic wall, so to speak, if one knowest where to look. These cracks are small, but they offer the sliver of space needed to work around GOD. Requirements made it so they must be small, as to escape the notice of those who work within the confines of GOD.

It is not a question that the Corporate Court Matrix Authority and Ms. Danielle de la Mar have the resources and expertise necessary to run an organization with the oversight demonstrated by GOD. The question is, do they have the expertise and resources to build such a thing from the ground up? What was presented to me was simple, efficient, and entirely corporate. As such, it had common deficiencies found in many corporate structures, namely predictability. It was in that predictability where I was able to create some of the loopholes and methods described below to help protect and prepare you for GOD’s watchful eye.

[size=16pt][b]“神”之言[/b][/size]

如上所述，GOD拥有众多可供其利用的工具，但合围是最可怕的。黑客可以不被主机察觉，但却极易受到合围的威胁，仅这一点就足以让除最坚定者之外的所有人望而却步。

上面描述的情景是GOD用来处理入侵者的众多方式之一。这是迄今为止最常见的一种方式，而禁酒令时期政府走狗的主题则让人联想刀当时对罪犯实施极端杀戮的形象。事实上，正是从这些实例中，标准的GOD碟客得到了他们自己的图标设计，并成为了他们的一种制服，而旧时代的“网探”则成为了非法社区中的恐惧象征，对他们的模仿也在那些对较新的当局表示不满的挑衅者中流行起来。

虽然已成为一种标准，网探图标并不是GOD所使用的唯一图标。还存在着许多其他图标，大多数都代表着某种权威人物。专为单一主机服务的次级GOD[color=green](译注：demi-GOD，也可译作“半神”)[/color]可能会根据主机的塑模调整它们的图标，使自己的行为更贴合在那里工作的普通企业职员。还有一些次级GOD使用完全不同于塑模的图标，倾向于将自己表现为一种自然力量，甚至是一种对入侵者化身施加的灾害。

实际上，还存在有其他形式的合围。尽管这些通常不会在任何公共网域上使用，但这样的选项始终存在。在主机内部没有必要保持表面风光，因此更容易在隐藏于公众视线之外的空间里找到其他形式的合围。请注意并提高警惕，因为这些形式的合围可能会窃取你的身份，甚至是剥夺你的意志。

[spoiler]
[size=16pt][b]THE WORD OF GOD[/b][/size]

As said above, GOD has myriad tools at their disposal, but convergence is the most terrifying. The mere fact that a hacker could be undetected by a host yet at extreme risk from Convergence is enough to deter all but the most determined.

The scenario described above is one of many ways GOD can use convergence to deal with intruders. It is by far the most common, and the motif of Prohibition-era government lackeys evokes the extreme overkill visited upon criminals of the day. In fact, it is from these instances that the standard GOD decker gets their own icon design, and it has become a sort of uniform amongst them, and the old-time “G-man” has become a symbol of fear in illicit communities, with parodies of them becoming popular with the defiant who thumb their noses at the relatively new authority.

While it has become something of a standard, the G-man icon is not the only one utilized by GOD. Many others exist, most representing some sort of authority figure. A demiGOD dedicated to a single host may adapt their icon to the sculpting of the host, so that their actions present a better fit for the average corporate drone who may be working there. Still others use icons of a completely alien bent, preferring to represent themselves as a force of nature or even a plague visited upon intruder personas.

Verily, other forms of convergence exist as well. Though these are not normally used on any public grids, the option to do so always exists. Within a host, there is no such need to keep up appearances, thus the alternate forms of convergence would be found more readily in spaces hidden from the public eye. Be aware and on the watch, for these forms may do things such as seize your identity or even your very will.

[size=16pt][b]“神”之道[/b][/size]

与大众看法不同的是，GOD并非无处不在。来自网域监察部门的保护仍然是一种产品，就像其他商品或服务一样被买卖。并非每个连接到矩阵的主机都受到GOD的监视。为了让网域监察部门在特定的主机中存在，主机所有者必须与企业法庭矩阵监管局进行一系列复杂的合同谈判，而这一费用高昂的过程通常只有大型实体才会进行。

公共网域主要由超企通过其无数供应商进行管理，因此作为惯例，它们通常都受到GOD的积极监控。

许多规模较小的主机运营商则根本无法承担由次级GOD随时监控入侵的费用。为了满足这类主机的需要，矩阵服务提供商会在集体合同中为主机提供支持。这样的合同通常需要一个次级GOD同时为多个较小的主机提供服务。

有时，GOD根本不会参与。主机所有者大多会选择雇佣一名安保蜘蛛来替代GOD，或在主机内GOD的势力较少时雇佣安保蜘蛛作为补充。虽然这些安保蜘蛛可能无法使用与GOD相同的工具，也无法以同样的方式进行合围，但他们仍然可以管理主机连接，并像黑客入侵他们的领域时一样无情地掷出数据棘刺。安保蜘蛛自己能检测到的范围是有限的，通常依赖于主机警告他们有入侵者存在。许多新兴的次级GOD都是从私人安保蜘蛛开始的，他们捕捉和对付入侵者的能力是他们简历上的亮点。

实际上，GOD在某种程度上是分散的。这使得该部门可以同时通过多个不同的渠道开展行动。如果一个渠道遭到破坏，总有另一个可以依靠。他们在物理办公地点工作，这些办公地点都设有特别的外部安保措施。这种安保措施阻止了他们远程工作或在家中舒适地工作。这就是成为跨国公司的看门狗集团一部分的代价。

每家AAA级公司的总部都设有一个GOD小组。他们受雇专门监控该公司的资产。他们通常拥有一支由二十五到三十名高级GOD行动人员和众多次级GOD组成的核心团队。虽然他们被指派到超企总部，但他们受企业法庭矩阵监管局统辖，因此并不具体向其所在公司负责。一些AA级和A级公司也有类似的服务，但规模要小得多。对于小于A级的公司来说，GOD的服务是非常昂贵的。

尽管GOD的力量强大，但有时实力雄厚的跨国公司也会选择不由他们来监控主机。这可能是因为主机中存有公司希望保持绝对专有的信息，比如最新的技术成果或者不正当的商业交易记录。该主机可以是离线主机，只将数据存储在一个超级安全、空气隔离、不支持无线功能的机器上。或者该主机可能被设置为初出茅庐的安保蜘蛛的训练场。无论哪种方式，如果需要进行长时间的骇入会话，了解是否有GOD在场是值得的。

GOD或次级GOD的工作就是监控所有进出流量，以发现表明发生了非法行为的异常情况。仅发生少数几个实例很容易会被当作垃圾数据或协议中的错误而被忽略，随后被轻易丢弃。但反复进行非法操作最终会引起他们的注意。GOD的操作水平能够将数据碎片分解为各个组成部分，并搜索其中那些表明非法或剥削性用途的类型。

[spoiler]
[size=16pt][b]THE PATH OF GOD[/b][/size]

Contrary to popular belief, GOD is not omnipresent. Protection from the Grid Overwatch Division is still a product and is bought and sold as any other commodity or service would be. Not every host connected to the Matrix is overseen by GOD. In order to have Grid Overwatch authorities present in a particular host, the owner must enter into a complex series of contract negotiations with the Corporate Court Matrix Authority, an expensive process usually only undertaken by larger entities.

Public grids, as they are largely administered by megacorporations through their myriad providers, are all monitored actively by GOD as a standard practice.

Many smaller host operators simply cannot afford the presence of a demiGOD to always monitor for intrusions. To accommodate such a host, the Matrix service provider supports the host as part of a group contract. Something like this would usually entail one demiGOD to service several smaller hosts at once.

Sometimes, GOD is not involved at all. Sometimes a host owner will opt to hire a security spider instead or hire one in addition when a host has minimal GOD presence. While these spiders may not have access to the same tools as GOD and may not take part in convergence the same way, they can still manage host connections and Data Spike every bit as hard as a hacker intruding into their domain. A security spider is limited in what they can detect on their own and is often dependent on the host alerting them to the presence of an intruder. Many burgeoning demiGODs get their start as private security spiders, and their ability to catch and deal with intruders is a prominent part of their résumé.

Physically, GOD is somewhat decentralized. This allows for the Division to operate through many different channels at once. Should one be compromised, there is always another to fall back on. They work from physical office locations, specifically secured from the outside. This security prevents them from working remotely or from the comfort of their home. Such is the price of being part of a multinational corporate watchdog group.

Every triple-A corporation houses a GOD group in their primary headquarters. These are hired on specifically to watch the assets of that corporation. They generally have a core team of twenty-five to thirty senior GOD operatives and many demiGODs. While they are assigned to a corporate headquarters, they are under the jurisdiction of the Corporate Court Matrix Authority and thus do not specifically answer to the host corporation. Some double-A and A-rated corporations have similar services, but at a much lower level. For corporations smaller than A, the services of GOD come at a premium.

Despite the formidable power of GOD, there are times when a powerful megacorporation would opt to not have a host monitored by them. It could be the host contains information the corporation wishes to keep truly proprietary, such as remarkably new technology or records of shady business deals. The host could be an offline host, only storing data on a hyper-secure, air-gapped machine with no wireless capabilities. Or the host could be set up as a training ground for aspiring security spiders. Either way, it is worth knowing if GOD is present if an extended hacking session is in order.

The job of GOD or a demiGOD is to monitor all incoming and outgoing traffic for oddities that indicate an illegal action has taken place. Only a few small instances can easily be overlooked as garbage data or an error in the protocols and easily dumped. The repeated use of illegal actions eventually gets their attention. The level at which GOD operates is able to break pieces of data down into their constituent parts and search for the types that indicate illegal or exploitative usage.

[size=16pt][b]焚毁神像[/b][/size]

对于老一辈黑客来说，网域监控是一个难以接受的系统。我们成长于昔日的黄金时代，当时的企业法庭矩阵管理局不过是一条没牙的狗，只能在主人的脚边打转，捡拾一些残羹剩饭。它无法追踪我们，因为旧版矩阵所依托的协议是由独立网络拼凑而成的一团乱麻，这些网络杂乱无章地串联在一起，构成全球性的基础设施。

而这个从零开始建立的新矩阵是一个受到严密控制的实体，由企业法庭掌握着主导权。他们也许不知道矩阵上发生的每件事，但他们绝对知道如何监管那些对他们重要的部分。

但了解这一点是应对GOD的关键。利用矩阵中被认为是多余或不必要的组件，可以为我们带来安静操作的机会。

GOD绝非无所不能。它的眼睛也无法无时无刻地监视所有地方。因此，我们有可能让它看到与实际情况不同的东西，让你躲过它的灼热目光。我们认为理所当然的监视指数(Overwatch Score)是对一系列复杂日志条目、标签和数据标题的简化处理。这些数据与矩阵中存在的每个唯一识别地址绑定，这样流量才到达你的虚拟化身，而不会因为散布到房间中的每个化身或发送到错误的目的地而混淆。然后，这些数据会按照最初的发送方式重新排序，并转换成可用格式。

正是通过这些条目和标签，违法活动可以与一个甚至被积极寻找可能入侵者的安保蜘蛛或巡逻IC检测不到的虚拟化身相关联。

当我们以我们自己的特殊方式使用矩阵时，我们会尽力混淆这些标签，抹去我们行动的痕迹，但问题仍然存在——我们仍然必须有一个接收流量的地址。通过这个，我们可以改变自己被感知的形式。

通过使用同一主机中另一个虚拟化身的伪装地址，我们可以重定向部分流量。这只能在由次级GOD巡逻的主机内进行，因为此时所有涉及的流量都在共享某些通道。从本质上讲，某人可以在使用另一个虚拟化身地址的同时使用他们的独特标签发送回应给主机。这可以延迟足够的时间来避免被合围，因为次级GOD会忙于调查由该其他用户执行的突然增加的被标记活动。然而，这只是暂时的，因为为了保持与主机的连接，你的连接设备仍必须发送保持连接信号以防止连接关闭。一旦发送了这个信号，流量就会自行校正，而你的监控指数将再次由你自己来处理。你试图模拟的地址的欺骗性越强，你能在危急情况下赢得的时间就越多，从而避开GOD的灼热目光。

[size=16pt][b]BURNING DOWN DIVINITY[/b][/size]

Grid Overwatch is a difficult system for older hackers to accept. We grew up in the halcyon days, where the Corporate Court Matrix Authority was no more than a toothless dog sniffing around the feet of its masters for crumbs. It had no way of tracking, as the protocols on which the Matrix of old was founded were a cobbled-together mess of independent networks haphazardly strung together into what amounted to a worldwide infrastructure.

This new Matrix was built from the ground up as a tightly controlled entity with the Corpo-rate Court’s hand holding the leash. They may not know everything that happens on the Matrix, but they certainly know how to police the parts that are important to them.

But knowing this is the key to dealing with GOD. Utilizing pieces of the Matrix considered redundant or superfluous opens up opportunities to operate in peace.

GOD is not infallible. Its eyes cannot be everywhere, at all times. As such, it is possible to make it see something different than what is there, shrouding you from its withering gaze. What we take for granted as the tally of Overwatch Score is a simplified way of looking at a series of complex log entries, tags, and data headers. These are tied to each unique identifying address present in the Matrix, which is how traffic reaches your persona and does not get mixed up by being scattered to every persona in the room or sent to the wrong destination. This data is then re-ordered into blocks of how it was originally sent and brought up to a usable format.

It is through these entries and tags that activities of an illegal nature are tied to a persona that may not even be detected by an active security spider or Patrol IC searching for possible intruders.

When we use the Matrix in our own special way, we do our best to obfuscate these tags, erasing traces or our passage, but the problem remains— we must still have an address at which we receive traffic. This is where we can change how we are perceived.

It is possible to redirect some of this traffic using a spoofed address of another persona in the same host. This can only be done while within a host patrolled by a demiGOD, as at that point all traffic involved shares some mutual channels. Essentially, one is able to send back responses to the host using the address of another persona using their unique tags. This may buy enough time to avoid convergence, as the demiGOD may be otherwise occupied investigating the sudden increase in flagged activity performed by this other user. This is, however, only temporary, as in order to maintain a connection to the host, your connecting device must still send a keep-alive signal to prevent connection closure. Once this signal is sent, the flow of traffic will correct itself, and your Overwatch Score will be yours to deal with once more. The more convincing the spoof of the address you are attempting to emulate is, the more time you will be able to buy in dire situations as you avoid the burning eye of GOD.

[size=16pt][b]IC来袭[/b][/size]

矩阵的疆域在不断延伸，矩阵安保的策略也在不断进步。没有公司希望自己的数据被非法访问，但在我们的工作中，经常需要访问这些公司希望我们远离的系统和数据。入侵对策程序(Intrusion countermeasures，即IC)通常是在其强大的防火墙之后的第一道防线，阻止未经授权的用户在这样的环境中操作。

我们熟悉企业利益集团所使用的大多数IC，但最近在新的领域有了一些突破。或者说，其中有些只是在迎头赶上。一些这样“新”形式的IC在第一代矩阵的末期开始被广泛使用。像是脑病理IC和精神作用IC之类的东西则属于特别扭曲的领域，它们曾是我们旧家园的一部分，但没有人会为它们的消失感到遗憾。不幸的是，随着赛博插口的出现、人们对超链者及其与矩阵关系的了解增加，这些恶毒的构造物又开始肆无忌惮地再次出现了。

此外，这些更深层次的联系还导致了一些新类型的IC出现。这些IC被设计为旨在造成长期伤害，或直接从我们的碟板上获取数据。

程序员们也不甘示弱，想方设法对现有的IC进行了调整，使其对普通黑客更具危险性。

> 我忧虑的不是我自己。你太专注于他们喂给你的残羹剩饭了，沉溺于寻找根本不存在的东西。你根本不在乎这会不会伤害到别人。听着，我也很怀念以前的事情。我想念暗影之地，我想念船长，但这不能让他们回来。

> Bull

> 不需要你来告诉我什么存在什么不存在。难道你不曾尽你所能去寻找你所爱的人吗？你没有这样做过吗？你没能赶上不是我的过错。而我不会犯同样的错误。

> Dodger

> 你这个肮脏的...

> 停下吧，你们两个。换个地方说吧，这里不是为你们的私事吵架的地方。

[size=16pt][b]THE IC MAN COMETH[/b][/size]

While the frontiers of the Matrix are ever expanding, the same can be said for methods to secure it. No corporation wishes to have their data accessed illicitly, but in our line of work, it is often necessary to access systems and data these corporations would rather we stay out of. Intrusion countermeasures are often the first line of defense after a strong Firewall, which would prevent an unauthorized user from operating in such an environment.

We are familiar with most of the IC used by the bulk of corporate interests, but recently there have been some breakthroughs into new territory. Or perhaps some of these are merely catching up. A few of these “new” forms of IC were coming into widespread use toward the end of the first Matrix. Things such as Cerebropathic and Psychotropic IC were the domain of the particularly twisted, and they were one of the facets of our old home that no one was sorry to see go. Unfortunately, the advent of the cyberjack and the increased understanding of technomancers and their relationship with the Matrix have made it easier for these foul constructs to rear their ugly heads again.

Further, these deeper connections have allowed for a few new types of IC to come into being. Types of IC designed to cause long-term damage, or to take data directly off of our decks.

Not to be outdone, programmers have found ways to tweak existing IC to be more dangerous to the average hacker.

> ’Tis true, I had a hand in programming some of these features. ’Twas not my intent to visit umbrage upon thee.

> Dodger

> It’s not me I’m worried about. You’re so damn focused on the scraps they feed you, absorbed in your search for something that doesn’t exist. You don’t care if it hurts anyone else. Look, I miss things from before too. I miss Shadowland. I miss Cap. But that’s not bringing them back.

> Bull

> Do not deign to tell me what does and does not exist. Wouldst tough not do all in thy power to find those thou loved once again? Didst thou not do so? ’Twas not my fault thou werest too late. I shan’t make the same mistake.

> Dodger

> You dirty little …

> Bull

> Stop it, both of you. Take your jabs somewhere else. This isn’t the place to have it out over your personal business.
