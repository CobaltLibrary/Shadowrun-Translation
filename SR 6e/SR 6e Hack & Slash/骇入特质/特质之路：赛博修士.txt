[color=brown][size=16pt][b]特质之路：赛博修士[/b][/size][/color]

大多数超链者都会避免植入殖装，因为精华损失会影响到他们与共鸣的连接，但赛博修士采取了不同的方法。他们与他们的殖装建立了深入的联系，有些人会说通过给殖装注入共鸣的能量，使其比他们的生物组件更有活力。第一批尝试走上这条道路的人走得太远，最终失去了与共鸣的连接，但其他人最终获得了成功。成为赛博修士的最初代价非常高昂。超链者们避免精华损失是有现实原因的，在你真正在共鸣和赛博修士的道路间取得平衡之前，你的能力会受到影响。有些人会说这是值得的。当你回顾过去，计算你所付出和你所获得的时候，你会作何评价?

[color=brown][size=16pt][b]QUALITY PATH: CYBERADEPT[/b][/size][/color]

Most technomancers avoid augmentations due to the effect of Essence loss on their connection to the Resonance, but cyberadepts take a different approach. They draw deep connections to their augmentations, some would say infusing them with Resonance energy and making them more alive than their biological components could ever be. Some of the first who tried to walk this path went too far and lost touch with the Resonance, but others found eventual success. The initial price of becoming a cyberadept is high. There are real reasons technomancers avoid Essence loss, and until you become truly attuned with the Resonance and the path of the cyberadept, your powers will suffer. Some would say it’s worth it. What will your assessment be when the time comes to look back and count the cost against what you’ve gained?

如果你的共鸣属性降到了0，你就永远不再是超链者了。该特质之路的殖装品级改进与对未来殖装品级的要求仍然存在，但你不再能从赛博修士特质之路中获得更多特质。许多这样的燃尽者转向寻求超人类主义(SWC，p.146)

[size=16pt][b]Risking Burnout[/b][/size]

If your Resonance ever gets to zero, you cease to become a technomancer forever. The grade improvements from this quality path remain, as does the grade requirement for any further augmentations, but you may not take any more qualities in the cyber-adept path. Many such burnouts turn to transhumanism (p. 146, Sixth World Companion).

你开始接受你的殖装作为你本体的一部分，而不只是某种添加到你身体上的东西。为了成为赛博修士，你必须先植入某些殖装，并且深潜来真正开启这条特质之路。你的第一次深潜必须选择赛博修士回声(p. 67)。一旦你这样做了，你就可以花费赛博修士特质之路中所列出的业力花费(不是两倍，与正常的角色创建阶段相同)来购买第一个特质。

花费：10业力

效果：当你使用殖装超载时，你可以重投一次获得的狂野骰。

[size=14pt][b]CYBERADEPT NOVICE[/b][/size]

You have begun to accept your augmentations as part of your identity, not just as things added to your body. To become a cyberadept, you must first acquire some augmentations and then submerge to truly begin the path. For your first submersion, you must take the Cyberadept echo (p. 67). Once you have done so, you may purchase this first quality in the cyberadept quality path at its listed Karma cost (not double, as per normal character advancement). 

• Cost: 10 Karma 

• Game Effect: Whenever you use augmentation overdrive (p. 282, SR6), you may re-roll the accompanying wild die once. The result of the re-roll is final, so maybe you shouldn’t re-roll unless you get a 1. Well, it’s up to you. I warned you. If any of your augmentations are standard or used grade, their grade effectively increases by one grade. Used grade becomes standard, and standard grade becomes alpha. You gain an Essence hole equal to the amount of Essence cost reduction caused by the changes in the grades of your augmentations, which is used for future implants before further Essence loss is applied. Because technomancers are primarily biological in nature, even bioware augmentations can be affected by this quality. This comes at a price—any new augmentations must be alpha grade or better, or else your body will reject them. The next time you raise your Resonance attribute, it only takes one minute—you must still pay the required Karma cost.

[size=14pt][b]CYBERADEPT DISCIPLE[/b][/size]

As you improve your connection to your augmentations, the desire to get more installed increases. Further augmenting yourself is a necessary step on the path to becoming a cyberadept, but you risk destroying your connection to the Resonance if you acquire too much. 

• Cost: 10 Karma 

• Game Effect: When you have lost 2 or more Essence, you may take this quality at its listed Karma cost (not double). You must have Cyberadept Novice and the cyberadept echo in order to take this quality. All of your alpha-grade augmentations become beta grade, and your standard-grade augmentations become alpha grade. This creates an Essence hole, allowing you to get more augmentations installed before losing more Essence. Any further augmentations you receive must be beta grade or better, or else your body rejects them. You may channel Resonance through your augmentations, bolstering them in a way similar to augmentation overdrive. By spending a Minor Action and concentrating, you increase the effective rating of one of your augmentations by your Resonance attribute. Sustaining this requires concentration and counts as if you are sustaining a complex form—though there is no complex form that can be perceived or targeted by anyone except yourself. At the end of every combat round, resist fading with a Fade Value equal to one half your Resonance attribute (rounded up). This ability cannot improve an augmentation’s rating any higher than double its normal rating and does not allow you to improve augmented attributes higher than their augmented maximum. You can only use this on your own augmentations, and only on one augmentation at a time. Unlike with augmentation overdrive, there is no added wild die or chance of cyberware stress. It may also be used on bioware. The next time you raise your Resonance attribute, it only takes one minute—you must still pay the required Karma cost.

Your augmentations have become accustomed to the Resonance. 

• Cost: 10 Karma 

• Game Effect: After you have lost 3 Essence, you may take this quality at its listed Karma cost (not double). You must have cyberadept disciple and its prerequisites in order to take this quality. All of your beta-grade augmentations become delta grade, and your alpha-grade augmentations become beta grade. This creates an Essence hole, allowing you to get more augmentations installed before losing more Essence. Any further augmentations you receive must be delta grade or better, or else your body rejects them. Your augmentations have become so well adapted to your body and your living persona that they are difficult for others to notice or affect, even when running with wireless mode on. Add your submersion grade to your Defense Rating and dice pool for any Matrix defense test on behalf of your augmentations—including resisting a Matrix Perception test to stay hidden. The next time you raise your Resonance attribute, it only takes you one minute.

[size=14pt][b]CYBERADEPT TRANSCENDENT[/b][/size]

Resonance has helped you achieve what technology can only hope to unlock one day: gamma grade augmentations. 

• Cost: 25 Karma 

• Game Effect: After you have lost 4 Essence, you may take this quality at its listed Karma cost (not double). You must have Cyberadept Master and its prerequisites in order to take this quality. All of your augmentations become gamma grade, regardless of their current grade. When you receive a new delta grade augmentation, it takes time for you to properly adapt and integrate it. While your new augmentations are adapting, they do not provide any bonuses for being wireless-enabled, but they must be wireless-enabled nearly the entire time. If you deactivate wireless mode for more than one minute at a time, reset the timer for integration. It takes a month to properly integrate a new augmentation, at which time it upgrades to gamma grade. If your augmentations are ever removed, they are useless to anyone else—even as used grade. Whenever you raise your Resonance attribute, it only takes you one minute. This only applies when raising your Resonance attribute up to 6. Raising it to 7 or higher requires the normal required amount of time to improve.
