嘿，狂奔者们，最近怎么样？Glitch联系了我，问我是否愿意为你们提供一份如何迅捷且有效地突破矩阵安保的高效狂奔指南，以及如何在需要时闯入那些你们并不受欢迎的地方。他还问我能不能简短点。这会是最难的部分。

现在是2082年，距离丹妮尔•德•拉•马尔在2075年推出新矩阵已经过去很久了。我观察到矩阵协议随着旧网域分隔的精简而不断演变。当你移动到由政府、公司控制甚至矩阵迷失域的空间时，你甚至都注意不到网域的切换。但不要自欺欺人地认为自己这样就身处于一个安全的空间了，因为隐藏在其中的所有者会替GOD监视你。此外，身处这个开放且无缝的矩阵并不意味着你可以看到任何地方的一切事物。大量的图标、化身会导致除了部分超级热门的主机之外的所有主机都不堪重负。但矩阵的底层结构仍保留有旧网域的残余，它们会在你搜寻目标事物时产生邻近效应。

如果你在目标附近有一件硬件设备，那么骇入附近设备并在矩阵上搜寻事物都会变得更容易。如果队伍中的潜行者能把设备带到某个地方，这样我就能更容易地了解其周围的情况，这对黑客确实很有帮助。那为什么不让所有人都潜入进来呢？我不擅长潜行，而且你把越多人带到现场，你留下的踪迹就越多，既容易出错，也容易被那些无人机和摄像头发现。只需要帮我把通讯链拿进去，这样我就可以四处检查了。当你知道你要找的是什么或是谁，并且他们正坐在对面街上一家受欢迎的豆炸鸡&松饼餐品车旁边时，这一切就变得容易得多了。

> 我知道有些队伍会前往某个地点进行侦察，但一旦到达那里，他们就不闯入第二次了。问题在于你会错过离开那里所需的信息。计划、分工、攻克。我曾经将碟客的通讯链带入设施中，作为我常规侦察的一部分，当你准备真正进入时，这将使整个行动变得更加容易。

Hey chummers, where y’at? Glitch reached out and asked if I would be willing to give y’all the quick and dirty for being effective running Matrix security, and breaking in where ya need to even if ya ain’t wanted there. And he asked if I could keep it short. That’s gonna be the hard part.

So here we are in 2082 and it’s been a long time since Danielle de la Mar dropped the new Matrix in our laps back in 2075. I’ve seen the Matrix protocols continue to evolve as the old grid separations have streamlined. You don’t really even notice when you move to a space owned by a government, corp, or even the wild Matrix. But don’t fool yourself that you’re in a safe space, as the underlying controlling entity is going to be helping GOD keep an eye on ya. Also, just because you’re on this wide open and seamless Matrix, doesn’t mean that ya can see everything, everywhere. The sheer volume of icons, personas, and hosts would overload all but some nova-hot hosts. But the underlying structure still has remnants of the old grids, which show up as having a proximity effect on seeing or finding what you are looking for. 

Digging into nearby devices and spotting things on the Matrix is going to be easier if ya got a piece of hardware near your target. It can really help the hacker if some of the sneakier members of the crew can bring the device to a location so that it’s easier for me to get a view of what’s around. So why not just bring everyone in? Well, I ain’t sneaky, and the more people you put on-site, the bigger your footprint is­—both for making mistakes and for getting spotted by all those drones and cameras. Just take my comm in for me so that I can check around. It’s a lot easier when you know what or who you’re looking for and they’re sitting across the street at a popular soy chicken and biscuit food truck.

> I know teams that head in to do recon on a site, and once there, decide they don’t want to break in a second time. The problem with that is missing out on the information you need to get out of there. Plan, divide, and conquer. I’ve run the decker’s commlink into a facility before as part of my normal recon, which makes the run that much easier when you’re ready to go in for real.

这让我想到了我与新团队合作时的另一个不愉快之处：他们总是认为所有搜索和进入主机的工作都得由我来做。就好像他们忘了自己也有通讯链一样。当然，他们自己可能无法获取非法访问权限，但他们可以搜索并获取对时间紧迫的黑客来说至关重要的信息。当我需要强行闯入主机时，有一些队友可以帮我放风或搜寻有价值数据，这就意味着我们更有可能在我不必修复我的硬件或湿件的情况下工作。甚至还可以更进一步。如果团队能够获取凭证和生物识别信息，这将使获得更高权限变得更加容易。骇入需要整支队伍的努力，所以请戴上你的护目镜或电极贴片并提供帮助。

抱歉我扯得有点远。成为每支队伍的搜索引擎真的会让人感到厌倦。碟客不仅仅是搜索引擎、摄像机编辑器或主机黑客。当然，我们可以做到这些，我会首先谈论这些事情，但我们也可以帮助定位战场上的敌人，保护你的装备，并执行从弹出弹夹到控制房间灯光的分散注意力的快速行动。

在我们深入探讨一些更深层次的技术话题之前，让我们再谈谈另一件我非常喜欢的团队可以帮助解决的事情：社会工程。从黑客角度来看，我会使用广撒网式网络钓鱼攻击，向员工地毯式轰炸般地发送消息，或者如果他们填写调查问卷，就给他们发送大豆塔可的ARO。这并不一定能让我得到我所需要的访问权限或者命中我正在寻找的目标。有时你需要一个社交能力更强的人来向正确目标冷推销，或者是诱惑或恐吓他们来得到你需要的东西。我的朋友总是把它称为获取某人凭证的橡胶软管法。[color=green](注：在密码学中，橡胶软管密码分析法是一种委婉说法，指的是通过胁迫或酷刑（例如用橡胶软管殴打目标，因此得名）从某人身上提取机密（例如加密文件的密码），可参见[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis]“橡胶软管密码分析法”[/url])[/color]

> 虽然你可能没时间对目标进行一场漫长的长期骗局来获得访问权限，但找到施力点依然很重要。也许目标与他们上班途中最喜欢的咖啡师有着特殊的关系，或者也许他们的家人突然需要帮助。这些都可以用来对目标施压，或者他们可以在目标不知情的情况下为你偷取你所需要的东西。

That brings me another team-based pet peeve I have when I’m working with a new group: the assumption that I’m the one who has to do all the searches or host-entering. It’s almost like they forget that they have commlinks. Now, they won’t be able to gain illegal access on their own, but they can search and gain information that can be critical on a time-sensitive hack. When I need to bruteforce my way into a host, having a few teammates who can spot for me or find that paydata means that we’re going to be more likely to get in and out without me doing repairs to my hardware or wetware. And it can go even further than that. If the team is able to get credentials and biometrics, it makes gaining elevated access even easier. Hacking is a team effort here, so slap on some goggles or trodes and help out. 

Sorry to go on a bit there. Being the search engine for every team that comes along can get really old. Deckers are more than just search engines, camera editors, or hackers of hosts. Sure, we can do that, and I will talk about those things first, but we can also aid in targeting enemies on the battlefield, protect your gear, and execute quick-thinking distractions ranging from ejecting clips to controlling the lights in the room.

Before I dive into some of the deeper tech topics, let’s hit another of my favorite things a team can do to help out: social engineering. From a decker’s point of view, I’m gonna use a net-casting phishing attack, send out a blanket message to employees, or put up an ARO for soy-tacos if they fill out a survey. That’s not necessarily going to get me the access I need or hit the target I’m looking for. Sometimes you need someone with a more social bent to cold-call the right person, or dare I say, seduce them or scare what you need out of them. My friend always called it the rubber-hose method of getting someone’s credentials.

> While you might not have the time to execute a good long con on a mark to get access, finding points of leverage is going to be important. Maybe the mark has a special connection to their favorite barista on their way into work, or maybe they have family who suddenly need help. These can be used to put pressure on the mark, or they might be able to steal what you need for you without the mark ever knowing.

随着一大批新物理主机上线投入使用，我收到了一些关于它们是否更容易被骇入，或者你是否真的能分辨出它们的区别的问题。首先，新(或旧)主机使用的协议和界面与2075年上线的结构层技术主机完全相同。结构层技术主机本应是未来的发展方向，老实说，它们现在可能仍是，但它们从结构层与共鸣域带来了新的威胁。因此，公司将继续做它们擅长的事：通过延长一些旧技术的寿命并实际投资研究新的主机硬件来适应不断变化的环境。结构层技术和纯硬件或框架式主机的工作原理基本相同。你不会在框架式主机中找到结构层，这确实有助于防止那些从空节点冒出来的矩阵威胁。但就获取访问权限、四处查看和执行指令这些方面而言，它们都是一样的。我的超链者朋友告诉我，他们的复合程式和网精在框架式主机中也能够正常工作。

解决了这个问题后，让我们来简单讨论一下怎么攻击主机或设备。我们已经讨论过使用社交技巧来获取凭证，但我们还没有讨论过你打算如何使用它，是通过暴力手段还是暗中潜入。首先让我们从最基本的开始：做好调查。在你提升权限之前，你应该弄清楚主机中是否有蜘蛛。如果你想要使用暴力手段，那么不设防的主机就是你的最佳选择，因为蜘蛛要花很长时间才能登录并给你制造麻烦。通过社交工程获得的凭证将在暴力破解袭击中为你提供你所期望的优势。

当进行长时间骇入时，你会通过寻找未打补丁的软件或防御漏洞来进行后门登录。拥有凭证将使你在进入系统时占据优势，即使在探查它时也是如此。如果你赶时间，那么在没有预先探查的情况下闯入意味着你只能依赖你的漏洞库，并期望其中一个能在这个主机上起效。如果你在没有探查的情况下从后门登录，那就会让主机占据优势。但你可以通过拥有凭证来消除这个优势。就个人而言，我总是建议新的奔跑者花点时间来探查弱点，然后通过这种方式进入主机。坦率地说——大多数情况下，你进入主机的大部分时间都是在让摄像头循环播放，或是清理你的团队为了降低热度而制造的混乱。这意味着不要让整个该死的主机系统警觉到你是用暴力方法进入的。

另一件重要的事情是，你甚至可以不需要访问PAN或主机就能实现你的目标。快速地伪造一个指令就可以拯救你小队的人。再配上分叉或一些新程序，你就可以在战斗中同时弹出四个弹夹。了解你的工具，知道什么是你不需要花时间获取更高权限就能执行的，以防止你的OS上升到危险水平。

这就引出了程序、代理、网精和其他一堆你需要掌握的工具。这些实用程序和赛博程序对你的成功至关重要。我编写了一些程序，帮助我管理我的一套赛博程序和智能框架，这样我就可以只用一个指令来切换它们。这种灵活性让我能够更快地更换装备，对设备或主机做出反应，这很重要，因为时间是你在矩阵中最宝贵的资产。我的典型设置基于我要入侵的目标。我有一套专门用于攻击和暴力破解的配置。还有一套用于探查系统，另一套用于处理文件和设备。最后，我还有基础的矩阵属性配置和处理AR中设备与PAN的程序配置。我都在运行什么？抱歉，但我不会泄露我的秘密配方。

> GOD一直在寻找正在运行的非法网络程序，因此，如果你总是运行你最热门的赛博程序，你会更快地引起注意。拥有可替换的程序来让OS降低就能在事态恶化前为我赢得一些时间

With a bunch of new physical hosts being brought online, I’ve been getting questions about whether they are easier to hack or if you can really tell the difference. First off, the new (or old) hosts use the exact same protocols and interface as Foundation-tech hosts brought online in 2075. The Foundation-tech hosts were supposed to be the way of the future, and honestly, they probably still are, but they bring new threats from the Foundation and Resonance realms. So the corps are going to do what they’re good at: adapting to the changing circumstances by extending the life of some of older tech, and actually invest in researching new host hardware. Foundation-tech and pure hardware, or framework, hosts are going to work pretty much the same as each other. You won’t find a Foundation in the framework hosts, which really helps prevent some Matrix threats bubbling up from the Null node. But in the ways that matter for gaining access, having a look around and executing commands are the same. And my technomancer friends have told me that their complex forms and sprites work just fine in framework hosts. 

With that question outta the way, let’s cover a little bit about hitting a host or device. We’ve talked about using social skills to gain credentials, but we really haven’t talked about whether you want to use that with brute force or if you can expoit a user’s credentials while going stealthy. First let’s start with the basics: doing your research. Before you go and elevate privileges, you should figure out if there is a spider in the host. Undefended hosts are ripe for the picking if you want to use brute force, since it’s going to take forever for a spider to log in and give you trouble. Having credentials from social engineering is going to give you the edge you’re looking for on a brute-force attack. 

When setting up something long-term, you’ll be doing a backdoor entry by looking for unpatched software or holes in their defenses. Having credentials is going to give you the advantage hacking into the system, even when probing it. If you’re in a hurry, then going in without probing first means you’re relying on your stable of exploits and hoping one of them is going to work on this host. If ya gain a backdoor entry without probing, then it’s giving the host an advantage over you. But you can negate that advantage by having credentials. Personally, I’ll always tell a new runner to spend the time to probe for a weakness and gain entry to the host that way. Let’s be honest—most of the time you enter a host, it’s going to be looping a camera or cleaning up the mess your team has made in an effort to keep heat down. This means not alerting the whole fragging host system that you bruteforced your way in.

The other big thing is that you may not even need access to the PAN or host to achieve your goals. Quickly spoofing a command can save your team’s soyrizo. Couple that with Fork or some of the newer programs out there, and in a fight you can eject four magazines simultaneously. Know your tools and know what you can execute without spending time gaining elevated access to prevent your Overwatch Score from climbing to dangerous levels.

This leads me to programs, agents, sprites, and the pile of other tools you need to get your hands on. These utilities and cyberprograms are critical to your success. I’ve written a few programs that help me manage my suite of cyberprograms and smartframes so that I can swap them in and out with a single command. This flexibility lets me change gears and respond to the device or host quicker, which is important since time is your most precious asset in the Matrix. My typical setups are based on what I’m going after. I have one setup specifically for attack and brute force. I have another for probing the system, and another for dealing with files and devices. Finally, I have my base configuration of ASDF and programs to deal with devices and PANs in AR. What am I running? Sorry, but I’m not giving away my secret recipes.

> GOD is always looking for illegal cyberprograms being run, so you bring the heat faster if you’re always running your hottest decking software. Having something you can swap out to keep the OS down has bought me the seconds I need before it all goes critical.

团队期望你做的另一项主要工作是保护他们的设备。当你们的街头武士的技能闭路在战斗中突然被关掉时，没有人会为此高兴的。好吧，另一个黑客可能会高兴，但谁在乎他们呢？我一有机会，就会与团队进行沟通，设置控制来保护他们的装备和殖装。而且，如果你不想让别人对你的东西乱搞，你可以选择使用有线设备或将其关机。就像你可以伪造指令重启别人的赛博眼一样，你也可以对你的队友做同样的事情。确保你的防火墙优先级最高，除非你真的不在乎你的团队。保护他们是你赚取报酬的工作。

这也意味着静默运行将取决于你隐藏PAN的能力。虽然机师已经找到了隐藏他们RCC的方法，但这永远不会像有一名专门的黑客保护团队那样好。在狂奔中，你最重要的决定之一是选择最大化防火墙还是最大化隐匿性。

The other main job the team expects you to do is defend their devices. Nobody is happy when your street sam’s skillwires get turned off midfight. Well, the other decker is probably happy, but who fraggin’ cares about them? As soon as I can, I talk to the team and set up the controls to defend their gear and ware. And really, if you don’t want people to mess with your stuff, you go wired or turn it off. Just like you can spoof commands to reboot someone’s cybereyes, the same can be done to your team. Make sure that you prioritize your firewall unless ya really don’t care about your team. Defending them is how y’all earn your pay. 

This also means that running silent is going to depend on your ability to hide your PAN. And while riggers have figured out ways to hide their RCC, that will never be as good as having a dedicated decker protecting the swarm. Your biggest decision on a run is whether to run with a maxed Firewall or maxed Sleaze.

碟客通常不会考虑的另一件事是主机或PAN上当前有多少个活跃化身。化身越多，隐藏起来就越容易，巡逻IC或蜘蛛来检查你是否应该拥有访问权限的时间也会更长。新手经常会认为在半夜攻击主机会更容易，但当你是登录的五个化身中的一个时，巡逻IC就会经常来检查你。

最后，让我们来了解一些可以让你在竞争中占得先机的新技术。让我们从那些炙手可热的黑客那里看到的最狡猾的趋势开始。他们从一些曾经的脚本小子那里汲取了经验，这些脚本小子曾经创建过已知漏洞的脚本。最重要的是，当你急于进入主机或设备，但又不想在进入途中触发所有警报时，你并不总是有多种选择。通常来说要么提前制定计划，要么直接踹破大门。而有了这种脚本，你就有了快速且悄无声息地潜入的机会。不过这机会十分渺茫。此外，我的一些伙伴已经开始熟练地快速切换他们的程序，以便在尝试闯入主机时拥有正确的装备，然后迅速切换到用于破解文件的软件。

[spoiler]

Another thing that deckers don’t normally think about is how many active personas are currently on a host or PAN. The more personas there are, the easier it is to hide, and the longer it will take for any Patrol IC or spider to come by and check whether you should have access. Too often, newbs think that hitting the host in the middle of the night is going to be easier, but when you are one of five personas logging in, that Patrol IC will be checking on ya frequently. 

Finally, let’s get the lowdown on some of the new techniques that are out there that can get you a leg up on the competition. Let’s start with the slickest trend I’ve been seeing out of some of the novahot deckers. They’re pulling moves from some old script-kiddies, who used to create scripts of known exploits. The big thing is that when you are in a rush to get into a host or device but don’t want to set off every alarm on the way in, you don’t always have a range of options. It’s usually either plan ahead or crash the gates. With this script, you have a chance of sneaking in fast and silent. It’s a slim chance, though. Also, some chummers of mine have been getting good at swapping out their programs faster in order to have the right loadout when trying to get into a host, and then quickly swapping to software to help crack files.
