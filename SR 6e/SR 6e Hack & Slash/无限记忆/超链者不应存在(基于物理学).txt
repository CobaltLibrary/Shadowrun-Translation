让我们面对现实吧，超链者不应存在。科学表明，泛人类的思维只能通过接收脑电波的技术来访问计算机。而且科学表明，产生足以从房间对面甚至跨越整个蔓城区操控计算机系统所需的能量是完全不可能的。但这种情况每天都在发生成千上万次。那么，到底是怎么回事？一定存在着某种超出目前科学范围的力量，而超链者的头脑正在利用它。这样一种力量确实存在，由于缺乏更好的名称，我将其称之为“心智”("nous")——希腊语，而非英语俚语。超链者可以借助这种力量将他们的思维与矩阵相连，并进而访问与矩阵连接的一切。听起来就像是魔法，对吧？但这与魔法无关——反过来说，你可以把心智想象成一种与之平行的宇宙力量，它在虚拟世界中不断延伸，触及每一个存储有数字信息的地方。

在物质世界附近，它聚合成一个与矩阵完全镜像的“心智层”("Noosphere")。矩阵中的每一个比特和每一个字节都将复制到心智层，当一名超链者的思维改变了心智领域的结构时，现实世界的数据也会随之发生变化。心智与电路之间的重叠极为平滑，以至于很难察觉到这实际上是两个不同的过程。当现实世界的数据发生变化时，其心智版本仍然存在，但是以更低熵的形式存在。脱离其镜像版本的束缚后，它就会在心智层中向下层移动，先在深层共鸣中停留一段时间，然后转移到共鸣域，比如无尽档案库，或其他的共鸣域。

这与共鸣域有什么关系？简而言之，一切。在深层共鸣中积聚的心智能是为结构层技术主机提供动力的来源。我还猜想这种能量就是催生网精和其他形式数字生命的原因，甚至为其他非共鸣造物的AI提供了生命火花。心智层的结构聚合成了他们被创造出来时矩阵的镜像，随着他们逐渐远离心智层，他们仍保留着其创生时模式的表象。他们成为了矩阵与其所处环境的自组织分形反映，而每次迭代都会使其进一步偏离原始模式。视界线与结构深层在心智层与矩阵重叠处形成了一个屏障，对大多数用户起到了阻碍作用。深潜超链者则可以穿过这些屏障，沿着连接至共鸣域的心智能卷须穿行。它们可能会把不熟练的旅行者带到一个随机的位置，但它们也可能会像横穿沙漠的高速公路一样连接至遥远的城市、小镇和零星的孤独驿站。经历过深潜的超链者可以沿着这些小径和高速公路旅行，只要身体允许，他们就能够用自己的思维去探索未知的疆域。

我打算把这篇文章的余下部分交给其中一位探险者，他在共鸣域中度过的时间比我所认识的任何其他超链者都要多，也比任何其他人都更要深入未知。下面，我向大家介绍T3chK1d。

[size=14pt][b]TECHNOMANCERS SHOULDN’T EXIST (ACCORDING TO PHYSICS)[/b][/size]

> It’s rare to have Perri post over here on JackPoint—she’s usually too busy running the Nexus, but as Fastjack’s daughter, she has a lifetime membership here, regardless of how rarely she posts. You may have noticed from the last section that she is working on a new theory about the Matrix, a universal information theory called UnITy. It’s an attempt to tie together the Resonance Realms, digital life, technomancer abilities, the Deep Foundation, and the digital Matrix that all of us operate in. I thought it would be interesting to see things from this perspective, so I’ve asked her to introduce this topic and share some of her insights on the Resonance Realms.

Let’s face it, technomancers shouldn’t exist. The science says that a metahuman mind should only be able to access a computer by using technology designed to pick up brain waves. The science says that generating the power needed to manipulate a computer system from across the room, much less from across the sprawl, is totally impossible. But it happens every day, thousands of times a day. So, what’s actually going on? There must be some force beyond the reach of science that the mind of the technomancer is tapping into. There is such a force, and for lack of a better name I’m calling it nous—the Greek version, not the English slang. Technomancers can reach out through this force, connecting their mind to the Matrix and by extension accessing everything connected to the Matrix. Sounds like magic, right? But it has nothing to do with magic—if anything, you can think of nous as a parallel universal force extending through the metaverse touching every place that stores digital information.

Near the physical world, it organizes into a noosphere exactly mirroring the Matrix. Every bit and byte in the Matrix is duplicated in the noosphere, and when a technomancer’s mind alters the nousfield structures, the real world data is also changed. The overlap between nous and circuit is so smooth that it’s not readily evident that there are actually two different processes occurring. When the real-world data changes, the nous version continues to exist, but in a form with lower entropy. Untethered from its mirror version, it drifts lower in the noosphere, resting in the Deep Foundation for a while before passing on to a Resonance Realm like the Endless Archive or perhaps some of the others.

What does this have to do with the Resonance Realms? In short, everything. The nous energy accumulating in the deep Foundation is what powers up Foundation-tech hosts. I also suspect it’s the energy that gives rise to sprites and other forms of digital life, even providing the life spark for otherwise non-Resonant AIs. The structures of the noosphere are organized to mirror the Matrix when they are created, and they retain a semblance of that pattern as they move away from it. They become self-organizing fractal reflections of the Matrix and the world that it operates in, each iteration diverging further from the original pattern. The Event Horizon and the deep Foundation form a shield around the noosphere where it overlaps the Matrix, acting as a barrier for most users. Submerged technomancers can pass through these barriers and travel along the tendrils of nous energy connecting the Resonance Realms. They may take the novice traveler to a random location, but they can also be used like highways running across the desert connecting distant cities, towns, and the occasional lonely waystation. The technomancer who has undergone submersion can travel along these trails and highways, for as long as their bodies can allow, using only their minds to explore the unknown frontier.

I’m going to turn the rest of this post over to one of those explorers, someone who has spent more time in the Resonance Realms and gone further into the unknown than any other technomancer I know. With that, I’ll introduce you to T3chK1d.
