> 继《Collapsing Now》一帖揭示了暗影协会(the Shadow Chapters)的存在之后，我四处打听有关矩阵内团体状态的信息。我需要几个方面的信息，而这三位提供了我想要的。你们中许多人已经看到Rikki的作品了，Gramius通过发布《Emerald City》和《Double Clutch》帖提供了帮助。Nybbles则刚在其他地方被介绍过。

网络帮派和公会的概念可以追溯到20世纪后期的游戏服务器。随着宅客的出现，“部落”一词作为一个引人联想的术语被添加进来，用来描述他们之间的联系。这个词汇现在已经转移到超链者们身上，对他们来说，这反映了他们聚集在一起时所感受到的联系。

> After the Collapsing Now upload revealed the existence of the Shadow Chapters, I asked around for information regarding the state of organizations within the Matrix. I needed a few sides of this, and these three came up with what I was looking for. Many of you have seen Rikki’s work percolating for a bit now, and Gramius helped with the Emerald City and Double Clutch uploads. Nybbles was introduced elsewhere recently.

The idea of online gangs and guilds goes back to the gaming servers of the late twentieth century. With the discovery of the otaku, the term “tribes” was added as an evocative term describing their association. That term has now shifted to technomancers, and to them it reflects the bond they feel as they gather together.

并不是每群人都能自发形成团体，他们需要某种形式的基础联系。可以肯定地说，现在每个人都知道什么是帮派(gang)、集团(syndicate)、团伙(ring)、公司、教会、国家，当然还有偶像团体(cult)[/color=green](注：此处应为泛指以个人崇拜为纽带的团体)[color]。在魔法世界中，有圈子(circle)、聚会(gathering)、学校(school)、支部(lodge)等等，这些团体也是为了达成同样的目的。类似的社会结构也存在于矩阵中。我们将为你介绍其中一些团体的内幕，他们有什么共同点，以及他们为何会走到一起。

在矩阵中，特别是当你在谈论矩阵荒野而自由的部分时，你必须调查一个群体的构成和目标。他们为什么会联合？谁可以加入？我能加入吗？他们会做什么？保持匿名会发生什么？任何在暗影中狂奔了足够久的人都可以告诉你，团队中的觉醒者成员，尤其是法师们，都拥有自己的团体并使用一打不同的名字来帮助他们进行自我认同。和魔法团体一样，矩阵团体也有很多自封的类别，比如圈子、分部、集会(coven)等等。对于本次发帖，我想重点关注两种团体。

[size=16pt][b]STRENGTH IN NUMBERS[/b][/size]

Not just every group of users is automatically going to work out. There is a need for some form of underlying connectivity. By now, it is safe to say that everyone knows what gangs, syndicates, rings, corporations, churches, nations, and of course cults are. In the magic world, there are circles, gatherings, schools, lodges, and more to serve much of the same purpose. Similar social structures exist in the Matrix. We’re going to give you the lowdown on some of these groups, what they have in common, and why some of them have come together. 

Out here in the Matrix, especially if you are talking about the wild and free Matrix, you have to investigate the makeup and goals of a group. Why’d they form? Who can join? Can I join? What do they do? Whatever happened to being anonymous? Anyone who has run in the shadows long enough can tell you that the Awakened members of a team, especially the magicians, have their groups and go by a dozen different names in an attempt to help them self-identify. And like the magical groups, they go by any number of self-labeled classifications like circle, lodge, coven, etc. For this upload, I’d like to focus on two kinds of groups.

[size=14pt][b]浮现团体[/b][/size]

当人们问及一个团体时，大多数人会想到它的组成、目标和资源。浮现团体与共鸣有着直接而密切的联系。这些团体的核心成员都是超链者，他们是共鸣或是失谐。这最终并不重要。

> 不要告诉他们那些。点燃战火吧！砖化的设备举目皆是…

> The Smiling Bandit

浮现团体与其他团体的不同之处在于他们是由共鸣个体和生物(如网精和超链者)组成的，以协助充分发挥他们的潜能。这些团体可能看上去非常类似于觉醒者的入门团体，甚至包括了成员们必须遵守的制度以保持团体的良好风度，但当他们违背团体的规定时就会遭受后果。只有浮现团体才能帮助其成员度过严峻的深潜并提供真正的支持。让这些团体从混合型团体中脱颖而出的另一个信念是：他们有能力开启通往符合其团体对称性的共鸣域的共鸣裂缝。哦，一个浮现团体也可能内嵌于某个混合用户团体中(继续阅读)。

[size=14pt][b]EMERGENT GROUPS[/b][/size]

These are what most people think of when they ask what the makeup, goal, and resources of a group are like. Emergent groups have a direct and intimate association with the Resonance. At their core, these groups are made up of technomancers, be they Resonant or Dissonant. It ultimately doesn’t matter.

> Don’t tell them that. The flame wars! Bricked devices as far as the eye can see …

> The Smiling Bandit

Emergent groups differ from other groups in that they are composed of Resonant individuals and beings, such as sprites and technomancers, to help achieve their full potential. These groups may appear very similar to an initiated group of Awakened, and even include policies that a member must adhere to remain within the group’s good graces, but they can suffer repercussions when they go against the strictures of the group. Only Emergent groups can aid their members through the rigors of submersion and provide real support. One additional belief that makes these groups stand out from their mixed-type cousins is their ability to open a Resonant Rift to the realm of their group’s symmetry. Oh, and it’s possible for an Emergent group to be nestled within a mixed-user group (keep reading).

[size=14pt][b]对称性[/b][/size]

组建浮现团体的关键是实现“对称性”。所有浮现团体必须找到并维持他们的对称性，才能获得完整的团体利益。这包括了共鸣超链者与失谐超链者。浮现团体有着特定的严格规章，这些规章超越了其他团体为使其成员团结起来追求目标而制定的规章。本章的游戏机制部分详细介绍了对称性。(第100页)

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]SYMMETRY[/b][/size]

Key to the formation of an Emergent group is the achievement referred to as Symmetry. All Emergent groups must find and retain Symmetry if they are to gain the full group benefits. This includes both Dissonant and Resonant technomancers. Emergent groups have specific strictures that go above and beyond what other organizations may have to help them unite to pursue their goals. Symmetry is detailed in full in the Game Mechanics section of this chapter (p. 100).

[size=14pt][b]混合用户团体(MUGs)[/b][/size]

这些是在矩阵中最经常与团体联系在一起的人。碟客、黑客、AI、单子，是的，甚至还包括了超链者和网精。正如我之前所说，混合用户团体中完全有可能包含了一个浮现团体。这里最大的问题是，非共鸣个体无法充分分享到更紧密的内部群体所带来的好处，而这些团体中的小团体和分支机构如雨后春笋般涌现出来，形成更小、更新甚至更激进的子集，这并不罕见。有时，尤其是在特别大的团体中，几个较小的团体会聚集在一个更大、更统一的保护伞下。行者就是一个这样的例子。

> 统一？你玩过《盟友与敌人》吗？只要总体目标或议程一致，大家都会很开心。一有变动，或者有人早餐时在另一个人的啤酒里撒尿，碎片化的速度就比以前的软存内核崩溃的速度更快。

> Red Anya

MUGs的优势在于更容易吸引成员。这种情况并不少见，事实上在矩阵中可能占大多数，但MUGs也往往寿命较短，除非他们的内部政治在某种程度上赋予了他们其他团体可能不具备的毅力。同样，大多数MUGs在团体或行为方式上也很像街头帮派。规模较大的团体往往要么领导结构非常严密，由较小的小组在各自区域中承担核心团体的任务，要么领导结构极其松散，这使得它们更难成为企业和国家执法机构的目标，并且在其运作中极为不稳定，可动用的资金储备也较少。

> 每个人都想知道加入矩阵团体有什么好处。对于《J.Q. Publican》的订阅用户来说，矩阵是一个提供信息的地方——健身计划、每日肥皂剧和拟感小说、在家工作的安全保障等等。而对于其他人来说，你会发现自己被锁定在一个虚拟循环中，直到孤星或安保承包商出现在你的家门口。团体可以帮助你摆脱追踪者、IC和其他各种追捕者。团体的其他成员认识你可能不认识的人。团体可以帮助你找到一个藏身处或安全屋，而你可以躺在那里，直到热度冷却下来。他们还可以共享某些程序，特别是防火墙和隐匿性实用程序，帮助人们从一开始就避免被发现。如果你是那种一头钻进超企不希望你去的地方的人，那么别人知道你不知道的东西会给你带来越来越多的好处。

[size=14pt][b]MIXED-USER GROUPS (MUGS)[/b][/size]

These are what most people associate with a group in the Matrix. Deckers, hackers, AIs, monads, and yes, even technomancers and sprites. It is entirely possible for a mixed-user group to have within it an Emergent group, as I said earlier. The biggest deal here is that non-resonant individuals cannot partake of the full benefits of the tighter inner group, and it is not uncommon for cliques and offshoots of these organizations to spring up and form smaller, newer, or even just more radical subsets from the original. Sometimes, especially with the exceptionally larger organizations, several smaller groups come together under a larger, unifying umbrella. The Walking People are an example of this.

> Unifying? Have you ever played Allies & Enemies before? Everyone is happy as long as the overarching goals or agendas all line up. The instant there’s a shift, or someone pees in another one’s Beerios at breakfast, there’s fragmentation faster than the old soft memory cores used to crash.

> Red Anya

MUGs have the advantage of being able to attract members more easily. It is not uncommon, and may in fact be in the majority here, but MUGs also tend to be shorter-lived unless their internal politics somehow gift them with fortitude other groups may not have. It’s also true that most of these often resemble a street gang in the way they form or behave. Larger ones tend toward either very structured leadership, with smaller cells taking up the cause of the primary group in their home grids, or they have extremely loose leadership structures, which make them both harder to target by corporate and national enforcement agencies and extremely fluid in their operations, with smaller financial reserves to draw upon.

> Everyone wonders what’s so good about joining a Matrix group. The Matrix is, for the everyday J.Q. Publican subscriber, a place of information—workout routines, daily soap operas and simnovellas, work-from-home security, and so on. For everyone else, it’s a place to find oneself locked in a virtual loop until the Star or the security contractor show up at your proverbial doorstep. Groups can help divert trackers, IC, and all sorts of other pursuers. Other members of the group know people you probably don’t know. Groups can help find a doss or a safehouse where you can lie low and let the heat cool off. They also can share certain programs, especially Firewall and Sleaze utilities, to help keep people from being found in the first place. And if you’re one of those types who digs into places where the megacorps don’t want you, the benefits of someone else knowing what you don’t just get better and better.
