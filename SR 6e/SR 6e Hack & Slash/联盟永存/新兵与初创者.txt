[size=14pt][b]811(埃弗雷特)[/b][/size]

这个组织在矩阵中仍然相对较新，但他们已不再独一无二。它是第一个全三合会分部（现在对类似三合会组织的称呼），或者说是完全由三合会成员组成的超链者部落。在街头，他们通常被称为“八·十一(Eight-Elevens)”，是西雅图北部埃弗雷特地区三合会88堂口的一部分，由龙头瑞克·吴和他的香主儒柏·董统治。瑞克·吴的手下最初专注于参与所有类型的矩阵犯罪，但他们已被批准协助北美以及东南亚地区的其他三合会组织组建其他全成员分部，重点关注香港、青岛和天津，这些地方已确认存在规模较大的超链者社区。

> 观察这种组织性援助非常有教育意义。它不仅展示出了适应能力，也展现了强大的团体在大型三合会网络中的力量。

[size=14pt][b]The (Everett) 811s[/b][/size]

This organization is still relatively new in the Matrix, but they are no longer unique. It was the first all-Triad sector (a name now given to similar Triad groups), or technomancer tribe, made up entirely of Triad members. Commonly referred to on the street as the Eight-Elevens, they operate as part of the Triad operations for the 88s in Everett, up in the northern Seattle sprawl, under the rule of Boss Rick Wu and his Incense Master, Rubai Dong. They originally focused on all the Matrix crime perpetrated by Boss Wu’s people, but they have been given the green light to aid in the formation of other full membership sectors for other Triad organizations in North America, as well as southeast Asia, with attention to Hong Kong, Qingdao, and Tianjin, where larger technomancer communities have been confirmed.

> Watching this organizational aid has been very educational. Not only is it showing adaptation, it also shows the strength in the stronger alliances for these portions of the greater Triad networks.

> Rikki
[/spoiler]

该分部的领导层由其成员自行决定，并根据任务任务的不同而变化。他们是伪造身份、身份盗窃、财务管理与滴定(洗钱)、贷款监督和交易安全方面的专家，他们一直很忙，并且似乎也乐于保持这种状态。埃弗雷特分部的具体成员数量不确定，但据信总数不超过二十人。他们没有自己的专属主机，而是使用88分部运营的主机和三合会自身维护的那些业务主机。

> 我不相信这点。他们这个组织似乎很有实力，不可能没有自己的主机。

> LPSD

> 他们或许拥有一台主机，但很可能只能通过他们管理的其他主机访问。既然他们可以随心所欲地进行选择并以合法经营为掩护，为什么还要把某些东西放在前台展示呢？

> Jimmy No

> 他们还在使用浮现动物充当信使。

> Plan 9

[spoiler]

The sector’s leadership is determined by their own membership, and it changes from task to task. Experts in false ID generation, identity theft, financial management and titration (money laundering), loan oversight, and transaction security, they are kept busy and seem to thrive on staying that way. The exact number of members in the Everett sector is uncertain, but it is believed to be no more than twenty in all. They are not known to have a host entirely their own, but instead use those hosts that are operated by the 88s and those businesses that the Triad itself maintains.

> I don’t believe this. Their organization seems too capable not to have their own host someplace.

> LPSD

> They could have a host, but would likely only have access to it by way of the other hosts they manage. Why put something up front when they can pick and choose as they wish and cover it with legitimate operations?

> Jimmy No

> They also use e-fauna to serve as couriers.

[size=14pt][b]自由海盗[/b][/size]

他们公开信奉开源精神和网络中立原则，期望建立一个不被企业割据的矩阵。他们的成员中有许多MeFeeds和Pito网红，他们会举行抗议活动，用AR标签在企业办公室进行宣传，并通过盗版渠道发布有关企业及其腐败项目的“真相”。他们有成百上千的自由海盗成员和支持者，尽管其成员大多都像是疯子或对矩阵一无所知的普通人。该组织的目标是迫使企业法庭修改CCMA的法规，并实施自由海盗的理念，尽管这通常只是企业公关部门的一些小麻烦，即使该组织的少数几位全息明星已经占据了虚拟演说台也是如此。

当然，这大部分时候都只是一个舞台，是对其更重要成员行动的掩护。虽然大多数自由海盗相信他们能够实现自己的目标，但小部分的核心成员已经意识到这永远不会发生，因此他们开始依靠自身力量来拆散公司，将收集到的有价值数据回馈给公众。这些成员会像上一代的全息海盗一样劫持全息电视台，让网络媒体播放他们自己的新闻。他们会破解软件以制作免费软件，通常避免选择更有利可图的敲诈或勒索软件，这样他们就不会冒被调查他们的GOD或次级GOD直接干预的风险。他们的大众声誉为他们提供了脆弱的“公众盾牌”，有助于他们避免实施那些真正具有威胁性的恐怖分子或极端分子会选择的更具决定性的行动。

> 不要认为这些人不愿造成伤害——他们只是更喜欢避免真正的麻烦，他们完全有能力实施白帽袭击，包括使用绦虫或数据炸弹来提取或干扰信息流，从而为自己谋求利益。

> LPSD

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]FREEBOOTERS[/b][/size]

Publicly, they believe in open source and wireless neutrality, a Matrix that isn’t divided by corporations. They have many MeFeeds and Pito influencers who stage protests, they AR-tag corporate offices with propaganda, and they distribute “the Truth” on corporations and their corrupt projects through pirate channels. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of Freebooters and sympathizers out there, with most of their member streams coming off like crackpots or a face who knows nothing about the Matrix. The group’s goal is getting the Corporate Court to revise the CCMA’s rules and implement the Freebooter ideals, which is usually nothing more than a nuisance to a corporation’s PR department, even when one of the group’s handful of trid-stars grabs the virtual soapbox.

Of course, most of this is just a stage, a smokescreen for the actions of its more serious members. While most Freebooters believe they can realize their goals, a smaller core realize this will never occur, so they have taken it upon themselves to dismantle the corporations and give back to the public, one paydata job at a time. These members will spoof trid stations like the trid pirates of earlier generations and get network media to broadcast their own news. They’ll crack software in order to create freeware, usually avoiding the more lucrative options of extortion or ransomware so they do not risk the direct intervention of the GODs or demi-GODs investigating them. The tenuous “public shield” their general reputation grants them helps them avoid the more decisive actions that a truly threatening terrorist or extremist operative might choose.

> Do not think these people are against doing damage—they just prefer to avoid real heat, and are more than capable of implementing white-hat-related assaults involving tapeworms or data bombs to extract or disrupt the flows of information to their benefit.

> LPSD
[/spoiler]

他们的成员中有一些知名影响者，比如拟感明星、音乐家和其他娱乐界人士，他们正试图获得某种形式的街头信誉，以提升自身的存在感。这些人经常在各种自由海盗关注者的媒体上进行捐赠或露面。

> 哈利·金(Harry Kim)和布郎迪·李(Brandy Lee)，又名乔尔特(Jolt)和米迪(Midi)，作为拟感戏剧演员，他们制作的节目和音乐剧在他们的MeFeeds上播出。康卡斯特公司(Comcast Corporation)会处理他们有时产生的公关失误，但他们用订阅MeFeeds的用户群弥补了这一损失。他们仍然是该组织更大规模行动的忠实支持者，他并拥有一系列账户来区分公开合法的活动，作为筹款的前台。

[spoiler]

Among their members are a few high-profile influencers like simstars, musicians, and others in the entertainment industry who are trying to get some form of street cred to elevate their presence. It’s not uncommon for these individuals to give donations or make appearances on various Freebooter subscriber feeds.

> Harry Kim and Brandy Lee, also known as Jolt and Midi, are simsense theater actors who produce shows and musicals streamed on their MeFeeds. Comcast Corporation handles PR mishaps they sometimes generate, but they make up for it with the subscriber base that sources their MeFeeds. They remain great supporters of the larger group’s actions, with a chain of accounts to separate publicly legal activities that serve as a fundraising front.

[/spoiler]

大多数人认为，阿玛迪斯·巴德鲁克(Amadeus Badruk)是这个组织的领导人，他是一名加利福尼亚自由州的兽人，大约在十年前将无线中立运动推到了聚光灯下。他拥有媒体高管所有的魅力和礼仪，创建了一个由名声和财富构成的网络，并据信为整个组织提供了资金。多年来，阿玛迪斯曾数次被“猎头”，无论是字面意义上(挖角)还是比喻意义上(追杀)。他目前的总部位于洛杉矶，不过他经常在黑森林度假，显然他收入不菲。他将大部分矩阵工作委派给了地方组织，但他仍然在利用自己累积的Pito评分和相关的名气寻找其他媒体盟友。

> 巴德鲁克先生并不只有一张漂亮的脸蛋，他也有自己的矩阵技能，这对发起运动起到了推动作用。我听说Perianwyr早期曾试图招募他担任经理，但被Badruk婉言谢绝了。我的一个消息来源称，他们时不时还会一起喝酒。他通常穿得很时髦，这对他的形象很有帮助。

> WuPing

[spoiler]

Most point to Amadeus Badruk, a Cal-Free ork who pushed the wireless neutrality movement into the spotlight about a decade ago, as being a leader of this organization. He has all the charisma and etiquette of a media executive, creating a network of fame and fortune that supposedly funds the whole organization. Amadeus has been headhunted, both literally and figuratively, a few times over the years. His current headquarters are in Los Angeles, though he vacations in the Black Forest, so he evidently makes good cred. Delegating much of the Matrix work to local groups, he still uses his accrued Pito score and associated fame to find other media allies.

> Mr. Badruk is not just a pretty face; he has his own Matrix skills, which helped start the movement. I heard that Perianwyr tried to recruit him as manager in the early days, but Badruk gracefully declined. One of my sources claims they still have drinks from time to time. He usually dresses stylishly, so it helps his image.

找到自由海盗很容易，因为他们利用的是极为公开的舞台。许多MeFeed都能引导你找到支持自由海盗理念的艺人。而当你关注名人时，会有半打黑客和崇拜者在幕后检查你的合法性并评估你可能代表的威胁。如果你想加入自由海盗，最简单的方法是发送一份MeFeed简历，这样你就会收到一份Pito邀请，然后他们会在现场直播的观众面前测试你的技能和道德品质。通过测试，你就可以与当地的自由海盗组织会面。要见到巴德鲁克先生则需要一些真才实学或重要数据。

> 自由海盗喜欢用Pito来对新成员施压。观众的反馈有助于淘汰那些偶尔混进来的公司走狗或冒牌黑客。带上爆米花！

> /dev/grrl

[spoiler]

It’s easy to find Freebooters, since they utilize very public stages. Many a MeFeed will lead to an actor supporting the Freebooter message. And while you are looking at the celebrity, you’ll have half a dozen deckers and wannabes behind the curtain, checking your legitimacy and sizing up the threat you may represent. If you wanted to join the Freebooters, the easiest way is to send in a MeFeed résumé, which’ll get you a Pito invite, from which they will test your skills and moral character before an often-live audience. Pass the test, and you get an audience with one of the local Freebooter groups. Getting an audience with Mr. Badruk would take some serious talent or paydata retrieved.

> Freebooters love to put the Pito screws to new recruits. The audience feedback helps weed out the occasional corporate stooge or hacker wannabe. Bring popcorn!

[size=14pt][b]光灵部落[/b][/size]

[color=purple][size=12pt][b]陶斯-普韦布洛部落主权, 普韦布洛公司理事会[/b][/size][/color]

许多超链者团体称自己为部落。在至少一个实例中，这是一个合法术语，适用于一个寻求形成公认部落组织的超链者团体。光灵部落(Light of Spirits)是三年避难和建设性公民努力的成功，这些努力始于从西南大陆其他地方搬迁过来的人，包括拉斯维加斯、丹佛、菲尼克斯、墨西卡利、诺加莱斯、阿尔伯克基和华雷斯城。该部落的核心是一组共计二十名超链者，他们都声称听到并回应了来自矩阵实体科科佩利(Kokopelli)的歌声召唤，随后迁徙到陶斯。科科佩利是一位在几个世纪以来受到霍皮、普韦布洛和祖尼部落尊敬的神祇，通常与生育联系在一起。这位存在与许多非地球生物有联系，他的歌声在星空中回荡。

> 是的，让我们现在就说出来……外星人！

> 他们非常有智慧。虽然领地意识很强，但他们很好相处。

[size=14pt][b]LIGHT OF SPIRITS[/b][/size]

[color=purple][size=12pt][b]Taos Pueblo Tribal Sovereignty, Pueblo Corporate Council[/b][/size][/color]

Many technomancer groups refer to themselves as tribes. In at least one instance, this is a legitimate term applying to a group of technomancers who sought to form themselves into a recognized tribal body. Light of Spirits is the result of three solid years of sanctuary-seeking and constructive citizenship efforts that started with individuals who relocated from other parts of the southwestern continent, including Las Vegas, Denver, Phoenix, Mexicali, Nogales, Albuquerque, and Ciudad Juarez. At the core of the tribe is a group of twenty technomancers who all claim to have heard and answered a song-like summons to Taos from the Matrix entity Kokopelli, a deity that has been honored and revered throughout the many Hopi, Pueblo, and Zuni tribes over several centuries. Commonly associated with fertility, Kokopelli is a being that has many non-terrestrial ties and whose songs echo across the stars.

> Yup, let’s all say it now folks … ALIENS!

> Clockwork

> They are very intellectual. Territorial, but good people to know.

> The Refugee
[/spoiler]

与许多组织不同的是，他们在出发时没有会让他们与任何人发生直接冲突的任何目标或秘密议程。创始成员都是寻求避难者，他们希望躲藏或逃离那些曾经伤害过他们或让他们受苦受难的地方。除了在部落歌谣中讲述他们在陶斯首次会面并迅速成为朋友，并很快发展成为家庭纽带的故事之外，创始人之间的实际交流方式或时刻并没有被提及。这无疑在他们最终形成对称性的行动中发挥了作用，并使得他们被普韦布洛民族中更大的群体所接纳。

自成立以来，部落最初接纳了几十个人，现在则总共有几百人，其中有五十多个新成员是在过去两年内加入的。他们的部落中心位于陶斯领地北部的普韦布洛峰脚下。许多成员从事半农村社区的常规工作，不过该地区也建立了几家小型农业企业，种植从水果和蔬菜到冬小麦和夏野草等各种作物。

[spoiler]

Unlike many organizations, they set out without goals or any secret agenda that placed them into direct conflict with anyone. The founding members were all sanctuary seekers, wishing to hide or break away from places that had wronged them or where they had suffered. The actual means or moment of communication between the founders is not spoken of save in tribal songs, telling of the group meeting for the first time in Taos itself and becoming friends, quickly developing into a familial bond. This no doubt played a part in their eventual Symmetry-forming actions and later led to their acceptance into the greater peoples of the Pueblo Nations.

Since the founding, the tribe has accepted at first many dozens, and now a few hundred individuals in total, with more than fifty of the new members added in the last two years’ time. Their tribal center is located at the foot of Pueblo Peak, in the northern portion of the Taos territory. Many of its members work regular jobs that one might expect in semi-rural communities, though several small agricultural businesses have been established in the area, growing everything from fruits and vegetables to winter wheat and summer wild grasses.
[/spoiler]

> 是时候澄清一下了。该地区确实有几家农业企业，他们经营的垂直农业在维护水资源方面取得了显著成效。他们也确实种植在水果和蔬菜，如西梅、李子、杏子和鳄梨。不过，他们种植的小麦品种与过去十年内在非洲大陆类似地区发现的品种大不相同。这种小麦对害虫和杀虫剂都有惊人的抵抗力，甚至在一年多前袭击该地区的野火中幸存下来。有消息称，阿兹特科技公司正在资助这种新型小麦，但一切都是合法的。另一个更大的赚钱项目是罂粟，特别是“路西法罂粟”变种，这是一种源自加州罂粟的变种，其花瓣和种子被用于制备十几种合法生物医学物质，而非法的则是合法的两倍之多。这些田地总是受到多种安保监控。路西法罂粟的专利由部落委员会持有，而该委员会本身受更大的PCC架构管理。

> The Smiling Bandit

> 那么，一个还不到六年的部落是如何培育出这种新植物的呢？

> Ecotope

> 目前还没有确切的答案。不过你可以放心，在我们说话的时候，很多人正在努力弄清楚这一点。

> Gramius

> Refugee说光灵部落领地意识强烈没错。那里确实有些事情在发生——那些田地完全被干扰场覆盖，几乎阻止所有类型的矩阵通信。据我所知，唯一能在那里正常活动的人是部落的安保人员，他们从不在外界露面。至于星界？那些田地是活的！

> Ethernaut

> 你应该从我们观察的地方看看。

> Eeroo

[spoiler]

> Time to clarify. There are indeed several agribusinesses that are in the area, with vertical farming taking a strong hold to maintain water resources. It is also true they grow fruits and vegetables such as prunes, plums, apricots, and avocados. They do, however, grow a wheat strain that is unrecognizable from strains found in similar parts of the continent just a decade ago. The stuff is incredibly resistant to pests and pesticides alike, having even survived a wildfire that struck the region just over a year ago. Word is that Aztechnology is helping to fund this new strain, but everything is on the up and up. The other, larger money-maker is poppy. In particular, the Eschscholzia Luciferium variant of the flower. A derivative of the California poppy, “Lucifer’s poppy” is a variant whose flowering petals and seeds are used in a dozen legal and twice that number of illegal biomedical substances. All sorts of security monitor those fields, always. The patents for E. Luciferium are held by the tribe’s council, which is itself governed by the larger PCC structure.

> The Smiling Bandit

> So how did a tribe that is not even half a dozen years old produce this new plant?

> Ecotope

> There are no solid answers yet. You can be assured, though, that a lot of people are trying to figure this out as we speak.

> Gramius

> The Refugee wasn’t lying when they said Light of Spirits were territorial. There’s something going on there—those fields are completely covered by a jamming field that inhibits pretty much all types of Matrix-based communication. The only people I know of who can still function there are the tribe’s security employees, who are never out in the open for observation. As for the astral? Those fields are alive!
