> 我允许这个条目的存在是因为它提供了迄今为止比我们所拥有的任何其他条目都更多的有关“百脑汇”的信息。我已经请Netcat检查了真实性，她回来时比平时更加震惊。我不确定Gramius和Nybbles是如何遇到Denizen的，因为这是深层共鸣的事情，我无法亲自证实。Denizen也是一名超链者，但直到最近他们才被大家发现。

> Glitch

我先简单介绍一下自己。我是一名超链者，最初出生在阿兹特兰。我曾是丹佛的一名宅客，直到一个虫巢消灭了我们部落的大部分人。然后我来到了亚特兰大，接着是佛罗里达州的迈尔斯堡，在那里我深入了深层共鸣，而我的身体则被我的一个朋友看管着。74年我再次出现，发现自己已经过了青春期，并积累了丰富的经验。我了解到命运多舛的百脑汇的起源，也知道他们是如何被利用的。在我深潜期间，我差点就加入了他们的行列；只是因为我的朋友总是在不停地移动，我才逃脱了他们的非自愿行动。嗯，大部分都是非自愿的。我当时部落的其他成员就没那么幸运了。

正是通过我与部落家庭的旧人脉，我才能够发现、跟踪并报告我现在提出的信息。从外部观察，百脑汇理论在其最原始的形式下是有其理论依据的。毕竟，如果你能将越来越多的兼容硬件连接起来，你就能获得越来越大的算力。但最大的问题是，从事这项工作的人根本不知道自己在做什么。或者说，如果他们知道，那么他们得到的帮助也许是任何人都不应该得到的。仅仅将任意一群超链者聚在一起，指望他们能团结一致，共享处理数据的天生能力，这本身就是一种非同寻常的自负行为。

> I’m allowing this entry because it has more information about “the 100” than anything else we’ve had to date. I’ve asked Netcat to check veracity, and she came back more shaken than normal. Exactly how Gramius and Nybbles met “Denizen” I am uncertain, simply because this is a Deep Resonance thing and not something I can personally attest to. Denizen is also a technomancer, but they’ve managed to stay off everyone’s radar until recently.

> Glitch

I’ll start with a brief introduction. I’m a technomancer, originally born in Aztlan. I was an otaku in Denver until a bug hive took out most of my tribe. I then made my way to the Atlanta sprawl, then Fort Myers, Florida, where I leaped into the Deep Resonance while my body was under watch by a friend of mine. I resurfaced back in ’74 to find myself beyond adolescence and armed with a great deal of experiences. I know about the origins of the ill-fated one hundred, as well as how they were used. I nearly joined them while I was submerged; it’s only because my friend was always on the move that I escaped their involuntary endeavor. Well, most of them were involuntary, anyway. Other members of my tribe at the time were not so lucky.

It was through my older connection to my tribal family that I was able to discover, follow, and report the information I now present. When viewed from the outside, the theory of the one hundred at its rawest form makes sense. After all, if you can link greater and greater amounts of compatible hardware, you can get greater and greater capabilities. The largest problem was that the people who did it really had no idea what they were doing. Or if they did, then they were getting help that perhaps no one really should’ve had. Just plugging any group of technomancers together and expecting them to all work as one and share their inherent ability to process data is itself an extraordinary act of conceit.

这些个体被搜集自世界各地，每家超企都为这个项目贡献出了自己的一份力量。没有任何一家是无辜的，甚至是以往通常会避开这些领域的EVO或五行也是一样。我要说的是，有四家超企对此做出了比其他公司更多的贡献，我会列出它们的名字。排在榜首的两家公司应该不会让人感到意外。第三和第四位的贡献者则使我们对这项工作的程度有了更加深入的了解。

三津滨计算机技术名列榜首。我们都听说过香港和东京等地发生的暴行，以及其他地方的“医学绑架”事件，但我相信我们从未知晓过它们的全部。他们的努力使他们站在了最顶端，并帮助他们在这么长时间内保持住了这个位置。

第二是地平线。几年前的拉斯维加斯事件只是这家超企的冰山一角。排名第三的贡献者在解体前曾是矩阵巨头；新网为该项目投入了相当多的资源，包括近一打的超链者。排名第四的贡献者则紧随其后：赛达尔-克虏伯。

这四家超企贡献了超过一半被纳入该整合体中的个体。我们了解到的大多数团体都会给其成员保留一定程度的个人自主权。至少是一种自由意志的表象。然而，在这里，这种假象被移除、重构了。它被改造成了德·拉·马尔主导的计划所产生的虚假对称的一部分。事实上，这是必不可少的。

They were individuals collected from around the world; each megacorporation contributed some part to this project. No one was innocent, not even EVO or Wuxing, who normally avoid these areas. I will say that four corps put more into this than the others, and I will name them. The two at the top of the list should not be a surprise to anyone. The third and fourth contributors give rise to understanding the extent of this work.

Mitsuhama Computer Technologies is at the top of the list. We all heard about the atrocities in sprawls like Hong Kong and Tokyo, and the “medical abductions” elsewhere, but I believe we never understood their full extent. of the issues happening in sprawls such as Hong Kong and Tokyo and “medical abductions,” but I believe we never understood the full extent. Their efforts placed them at the top of the heap and helped them remain there this long.

The second is Horizon. The Las Vegas debacle some years ago was just the tip of the megacorporate iceberg. The third-place contributor was a Matrix powerhouse before it broke apart; NeoNET devoted considerable resources to the project, including nearly a dozen technomancers. The fourth contributor was close behind: Saeder-Krupp.

These top four contributed more than half of the individuals who were placed into the amalgamation. Most groups we learn of always have some degree of personal self-determination left to their members. A façade of free will, at the least. Here, that façade was removed, reworked. It was made into part of the false symmetry that was generated by the program de la Mar spearheaded. It was necessary, in fact.

[size=14pt][b]创建虚假对称[/b][/size]

这是让这个团体运作起来并实现其协调者所期望的结果的必要组成部分。Gramius告诉我，他们会在这次发帖的团体内容中讨论”对称性“问题，所以我就不再深入探讨了。但百脑汇中的每个成员都需要在某种程度上进行调整。在这群人中，有些人曾患有在60年代被称为AIPS的病症，也有人患有冠以其他名称的早期原型超链者疾病。有些孩子曾是宅客部落的成员，而且其中有些人并没有表现出曾经限制泛人类浮现的衰褪迹象。按照今天的标准，有些人无疑会被贴上“失谐超链者”的标签。还有一些人据信曾是Deus在当时的西雅图联络生态建筑中所实施计划的一部分。随着时间的推移，我逐渐了解到，每个被带入结构层虚假对称的人都有一些尤为独特或天赋异禀的地方。

[size=14pt][b]CREATING FALSE SYMMETRY[/b][/size]

This was a necessary part of making this group work and attaining that which was desired by its coordinators. Gramius told me they’d touch upon Symmetry as part of the groups in this upload, so I won’t delve into that any further. But each member of the one hundred needed to be adjusted to some degree. Within the group were people who suffered from what was known as AIPS back in the ’60s, and other names given to the early proto-technomancers. There were children who had been members of otaku tribes, a few who were not showing signs of the fading that once limited the metahuman emergent. Some individuals would no doubt be labeled as “Dissonant technomancers” by today’s standards. Others were believed to have been part of Deus’ programs within the then-Renraku Arcology of Seattle. I learned over time that everyone brought into the false symmetry of the Foundation had something particularly unique or gifted about them.

在项目开发过程中，人们发现，为了让人们能够访问全新的全球结构层并从最新的矩阵协议中受益，每一件硬件都需要进行更新。软件更新——有些人会称之为固件更新——也是必要的。某些较旧的硬件协议被有意设计在新系统之外，迫使任何想要访问矩阵的人都必须购买新的、建造新的、培训新的。这也是公司的首要愿望。当然，所有这些都无法实现，直到我看到其他人称之为“代码神器”的东西被找到并投入使用。

总之，无论如何，首先必须使用非拟感技术对个体进行编程，因为坦率地说，拟感“编程”无法对抗已浮现的思维。每个个体都必须被训练为相信他们想要的就是他们的协调者想要的。此外，该计划中还有二十几个自愿参加的人。这些志愿者是如何出现的，他们为什么在亨格斯特(Hengester)做的其他一切之后才出现，以及德·拉·马尔和她的团队是如何培养他们的，这些都超出了我的理解范围。

[spoiler]

During the development of the project, it was revealed that in order for people to access the new Global Foundation and benefit from the newest Matrix protocols, each and every piece of hardware would need to be updated. Software updates—some would call them firmware updates— were necessary. Certain older hardware protocols were intentionally designed out of the new system, forcing anyone wanting Matrix access to buy new, build new, train new. Which is a corporation’s first and foremost desire. And of course, none of this could happen until what I’ve seen others refer to as “the Code Artifact” was found and then put to use.

So anyway, the programming of the individuals had to be performed using non-simsense technologies at first, because to be honest, simsense “programming” just did not hold against an Emergent mind. Each individual had to be made to believe that what they wanted was what their coordinators wanted. Add to this, there were easily two dozen individuals in the program who were willing participants. How and why these volunteers came about after everything else Hengester did and how de la Mar and her team cultivated this is outside of my understanding.

[size=14pt][b]释放野兽[/b][/size]

当百脑汇的全部力量最终被释放时，它就像是一个庞大的主机池，完全符合德·拉·马尔团队的预期。起初，大家都很满意。虽然有一些小问题，比如无法直接联系项目中的那些自愿参与者。这个问题过了一段时间才得到解决，然后就没有问题了。尤其是在获取到“代码神器”之后。团队一掌握了那个东西，就没人再认为神器有多重要了。他们应该当时就注意到。百脑汇现在是一个全新的、伪共鸣矩阵的基础，可以完成旧协议无法实现的事情。如果你了解心智场的话，那么你就开始明白百脑汇到底发生了什么。

[size=14pt][b]UNLEASHING THE BEAST[/b][/size]

When the full power of the one hundred was finally untethered, it acted like a massive host pool, exactly like the de la Mar group wanted it to. At first, everyone was happy. There were a few glitches, such as the inability of those voluntary members of the project to be contacted directly. It took a while for that to fix itself, and then it went away. Especially after the Code Artifact was obtained. Once that was in the hands of the team, no one believed the Artifact mattered as much. They should’ve paid attention. The one hundred were now the basis for an entirely new, pseudo-Resonant Matrix that could do things the older protocols could never have pulled off. If you know anything about Nous Fields, then you begin to understand what really happened to the one hundred.

[size=14pt][b]拆除炸弹[/b][/size]

在70年代的后半段，团队决定尝试替换百脑汇的一部分。他们要求得到最大程度的协助，一些人相信，如果将新训练的超链者纳入“虚假对称”——其他人称之为全球结构层——他们能够获得更多好处。

所有听过这些故事的人都知道，事情并不顺利。但你们中的一些人可能不清楚这次交换的影响。矩阵1.0完全是由泛人类及其知识构建的，但这并不是极限。在矩阵运行的巅峰期，至少有些人认为，波士顿ECSE矩阵内爆发的崩溃2.0事件是第一个真正的奇点，是由手头的处理能力以及与服务器相连的个人和实体的算力总和形成的一个真正的数据黑洞。所有的心智能量都汇聚在这里，变得如此密集，以至于当耶梦加得病毒在该节点(或者你喜欢的话，第一个空节点)中被释放时，它在地球上不断增长的心智场中炸开了一个洞。

虽然全球结构层是在十年之后才建立的，但它以百脑汇为核心，立即与这些不断增长的能量场建立了联系。这就创造了倒影池的最初部分，以及进入深层共鸣的更深处的渠道。当百脑汇被移除时，就相当于在当时的倒影池中引爆了一枚核弹。这就是21世纪初大鬼舞的矩阵版本。

在深层共鸣中有着我们不了解的存在、概念和其他事物，我们也没有做好充分的准备。你们遇到的那些浮现实体仅仅是个开始。你不是，我们也不是毫无防备，但我们肯定还没有准备好应对这一切。这就是百脑汇的教训。拥抱矩阵中的迷失与自由之部分。

> 你不必说的。

> 没关系，我觉得有必要讲出来。你们中的一些人可能了解过各种共鸣域，也听说过其中一个被称为墓碑域的地方。嗯，那里有一条道路，如果你按照某种方式跟随标记，它会引导你前往这个共鸣域的不同部分。在那个比我想表达的还要广阔的地方，有一处叫做坟墓。在墓碑域中，每个程序都按其运行结束日期列出；坟墓则与此类似，但它列出的不是程序，而是每一个在连接到共鸣期间死亡的生物的名字。

[size=14pt][b]UNPLUGGING THE BOMB[/b][/size]

In the second part of the ’70s, a decision was made to attempt to swap out some of the one hundred. The deepest of favors were being called in, and a few individuals believed they might gain something more with newly trained technomancers incorporated into the False Symmetry— what everyone else labels the Global Foundation.

For those of you who have heard the stories, you know this didn’t go well. What some of you may not be aware of are the effects of the swap. Matrix 1.0 was entirely the construct of metahumanity and its knowledge, but it was not the limit. At the peak of the Matrix operations, at least according to some, the events that culminated in Crash 2.0 within the Boston ECSE Matrix were the first true singularity, an actual data black hole formed by the combined power of the processing at hand as well as the connected individuals and entities to that server. It became so dense from all the sapient energy culminating there that when the Jormungand virus was unleashed in the node, the first Null Node if you will, it blasted a hole into the planet’s growing Nous Fields.

And while it came a full decade later, the creation of the Global Foundation with the one hundred at its core immediately connected it to these growing energy fields. That created the first parts of the Reflecting Pool and the ability to enter deeper parts of the Deep Resonance. When the one hundred were unplugged, it was the Deep Resonance equivalent of setting off a nuclear weapon within the Reflecting Pool of the time. It is the Matrix equivalent of the Great Ghost Dance of the early twenty-first century.

There are beings and concepts and other things in the Deep Resonance that we do not know of, nor are we well and truly prepared for. Some of the Emergent beings you’ve encountered are just the beginning. You aren’t, we aren’t, without defenses, but we are certainly not ready for it all. And that is the lesson of the one hundred. Embrace the wild and free parts of the Matrix.

> So Netcat, what exactly did you have to verify that shook you up so much?

> Bull

> You don’t have to say.

> Glitch

> It’s okay, I think it needs to be said. Some of you may learn about various Resonance Realms and hear about one of them called the Tombstones. Well, there is a path that, if you follow the markers a certain way, leads you to a different part of the realm. Within that part, which is vaster than I care to express, is a place called the Graveyard. In the Tombstones, every program is listed by its ending date of operation; the Graveyard is similar, but instead of programs, it lists the names of every living thing that has died while connected to the Resonance.

> You have got to be kidding.
