[color=brown][size=16pt][b]享用美食[/b][/size][/color]

一个世纪前，烹饪好的一餐是三道菜的健康份量，但预制食品和即时满足已经将其简化为一道包罗万象的饭菜。方便取代了营养，烹饪也变得自动化。在漫长的工作日结束后，当你可以用微波炉快速加热营养豆餐，甚至当你还在通勤的时候就可以告诉你的大豆加工单元要准备什么时，谁还愿意在厨房里花费一个小时或更多的时间呢？企业持续推动着更高效、更加有利可图的作物生产，专注于超级产量的作物，如大豆和磷虾。随着过敏反应的增加和对吃“有机食品”的渴望，一些公司，如环球通用遗传公司(GGW)、英格索尔与伯克利(Ingersoll&Berkeley)、地平线和基因工程公司(Genetique)已经为大多数泛人们提供了替代品。然而，许多城市居民的主要饮食仍然没有改变。

大豆：在污染和企业对利润的渴望之间，大豆已经成为大规模生产的首要焦点。基因改造和传统农业的替代方法提高了其他主食来源(大米、玉米、小麦和土豆)的产量，但由于大豆的广泛营销和流行，并没有人注意到这点。由于过度摄入大豆，据估计每30人中就有1人对大豆过敏，这种令人不安的趋势还在继续增长。大豆存在替代品，而无需奢求于全“真正”食物。

磷虾：这些小小的虾填补了肉类的真空，而水产养殖场也因为它们而在世界各地蓬勃发展。大型筒仓式养殖场里有数以百万计的这些家伙在水箱里快乐地游动。到了收获季节，磷虾肉会被混合和压制在一起，然后以各种形式出售，包括用于加工单元的粉末和肉糜。其他动物蛋白变体包括了青蛙养殖场和蟋蟀孵化场。

真菌蛋白：真菌蛋白来自名为镰刀菌的蘑菇。它们可以在小空间内利用类似发酵啤酒的廉价资源大量种植。它们被压制为成型的膳食或用于加工单元的粉末。从营养学上讲，真菌蛋白是仅次于大豆的最佳食品。

藻类：最常见的是蓝藻和绿藻，被从淡水湖的湖面捞起，加工成食品和维生素补充剂。在沿海地区，海带被大量种植并被磨成粉末，以同样的方式使用。

A century ago, cooked meals were three dishes in healthy portions, but pre-made food and instant gratification has since reduced it to one all-encompassing meal. Convenience replaced nutrition, and cooking became automated. Who wants to spend an hour or more in the kitchen after a long workday, when you can quickly microwave a Nutrisoy meal or even tell your soy processor what to prepare when you arrive, while you’re still commuting? Corporations push for more efficient and profitable crop production, focusing on the super-yield crops, such as soy and krill. With rising allergies and the desire to eat “organic,” several corporations, such as GGW, Ingersoll & Berkeley, Horizon, and Genetique have come up with alternatives for the common metahuman. However, the primary dietary staples for many sprawl citizens remain the same.

Soy: Between pollution and corporate desire for easy profitability, soybeans have become the prime focus for mass production. Genetic modification and alternatives to traditional farming have boosted production of the other staple food sources (rice, corn, wheat, and potato), but with the widespread marketing and popularity of soy, no one has noticed. Because of overexposure, it is estimated that 1 in 30 have an allergy to soy, a disturbing trend that continues to grow. There are alternatives to soy, without resorting to the luxury of all "real" food.

Krill: These tiny little shrimp have filled the meat vacuum, and aquaculture farms are booming around the world because of them. Large silo farms contain millions of these guys swimming happily in their tank. Come harvest time, the meat from krill can be blended and pressed together, then sold in a variety of forms, including powder for use in processing units and shakes. Other animal protein variants include frog farms and cricket hatcheries.

Mycoprotein: Mycoprotein comes from mushrooms called fusarium venenatum. Large volumes can be grown in small spaces and with cheap resources similar to fermenting beer. They are pressed into shaped meals or powder for processing units. Mycoprotein is the next best, nutrition-wise, to soy.

Algae: Algae, most commonly blue-green algae, is scooped off the top of freshwater lakes and processed into foodstuffs and vitamin supplements. On the coast, kelp is farmed and ground into powder to be used in the same fashion.

[size=14pt][b]加工单元[/b][/size]

大豆加工单元(Soy Processing Unit, SPU)是三维全息视频娱乐系统(trideo entertainment system)和通讯链之外最常见的家用电器，在中低端生活方式的家庭中经常取代标准微波炉和烤箱。SPU的尺寸从微波炉到冰箱不等。就像桌面锻炉一样，SPU将烹饪从单纯的浇注、混合和烹调转变为从头到尾的重新构筑。大豆浆/糊状物被注入人工香料和颜色，塑造成特定的形状，然后用添加剂进行质地处理，最后通过微波加热使其在适当的位置变硬，从而再现出美味佳肴。虽然被称为“大豆加工机”，但所有型号都能够在某种程度上处理替代成分。 

SPU由HMSS(家庭管理软件套装，Home Management Software Suites)控制，以使它们能够接收更新、交换菜谱、订购食材，并以其他方式管理家庭的烹饪任务。包括SiA200在内的低端处理器可以制作基本形状的菜肴并可选调味，而像蓝宝石(Sapphire Blue)这样的高端处理器则使用模糊逻辑来创造更逼真、更多样化的菜肴。专业化单元，如豆先生与豆女士(Mr. and Mrs. Soy)系列，则为单品菜肴提供了进阶选项，如薯片、沙拉和鸡蛋。无论哪种设备，SPU都包含在必需品类别中。

[size=14pt][b]Processing Units[/b][/size]

A Soy Processing Unit (SPU) is the most widespread household appliance outside the trideo entertainment system and commlink, frequently replacing the standard microwave and oven in Low and Middle lifestyle homes. SPUs range in size from microwave to refrigerator. Like a desktop forge, a SPU moves cooking from just being poured, mixed, and cooked to being architecturally built from the ground up. The soy-pulp/paste is injected with artificial flavors and color, sculpted into a given shape, and then texturized with additives before being microwave zapped to harden it at appropriate points to recreate culinary delights. While called “soy processors,” all models are capable of handling alternative ingredients to some extent.  

SPUs are controlled by the HMSS to allow them to receive updates, swap recipes, order ingredients, and otherwise manage the culinary tasks of the household. Low-end processors, including the SiA 200, create basic shapes with optional flavoring, while high-end processors like Sapphire Blue use fuzzy logic to create more realistic and varied dishes. Specialized units, such as the Mr. and Mrs. Soy line, provide upgraded options for single items, such as chips, salads, and eggs. Regardless of the kind of unit, the SPU is included in the category of Necessities.
