丹佛，FRFZ，2074年12月1日

女士们，先生们，以及所有矩阵中的实体们，今天我来到你们面前，带来了一个将永远改变你们矩阵体验的消息。你们将再也不需要害怕不法黑客和流氓AI的行为。当你们打开数字宇宙，享受最新的高清拟感游戏时，你们将再也不会感到恐惧。

你们所有人都非常友好地接受了这一邀请，能够率先体验由新网与三津滨计算机科技公司联合开发和托管的新全球公共网域。在你们接入后就能访问我们提供的图标。

当这个程序运行并协助你们的通讯链调整到这个增强网域的新协议时，让我来告诉你们即将发生的事情。

我们的节点将不再是异类的乐园。在企业法庭及其网域监察部门所有成员的通力协作下，新协议将比以往任何时候都更快地检测和拒绝异常行为。现在，不法黑客们将恐惧GOD对他们的时刻注视。

通过将公共网域的算力分散到数以万计的地面和轨道基站，新的矩阵结构将允许全球访问，而不会使个人和本地资源过载。新的矩阵将更加安全和强大，更加注重精确地排除故障，而不是像最近几年那样，由于不法分子的鲁莽行为而导致节点关闭，从而对无辜者造成伤害。

网域将相互重叠，每个人都可以通过最简单的通讯链或接入设备访问公共网域，地方、国家和企业网域将对公共网域进行扩充和增强。企业法庭的每个成员都已经在为其公民和用户开发自己的网域，而其中许多公司，尤其是新网和三津滨，正在与地方和国家政府进行合同谈判，以开发采用新的更安全协议的网域。

我看到大家都已经成功下载了新软件。请大家使用配套的电极贴片或自己的硬件(如果硬件已经升级)访问新的矩阵，并与我一同接入新的公共网域，继续这项改变我们生活的事业。安保系统将确保我们在这趟短暂旅程中的安全。

欢迎来到全新的全球网域！首先我想说明的是，这个新网域并不排斥我们的技术智能。我们已经进行了大量的研究，表明这一新协议与AI、超链者和所有其他的技术智能兼容。

(人群鼓掌) 

从今天起，全世界的公民都可以访问矩阵，并最终在这个无线世界里感到安全。全球公共网域现在对任何下载新协议的人开放。在接下来的几个月里，企业法庭的成员企业将上线它们的网域，并与公共网域连接，同时为它们的企业公民提供额外的服务。明年年初，世界各国将逐步推出自己的矩阵。到2075年4月1日，世界各国和城邦都将提供这项新的安全措施。我们将进入一个矩阵的黄金时代，在这个时代，世界各地的公民可以与任何人，任何地方通讯和交流，而且不用担心黑客这种离经叛道的无政府主义亚文化对他们的侵害。

我们正站在一个自由和安全的无线矩阵的边缘。我们会一起实现这一飞跃，并将共同翱翔于新的高度。

但我要警告的是，即将到来的变革绝不会是完全和平或毫无困难的。异类们会试图阻挠这场变革。他们会雇佣他们的暗影狂奔者，或是拉拢矩阵帮派，恐吓正在打造新世界的那些新网和MCT的善良人们。我们必须坚定地抵御这些敌人，向他们表明我们想要一个全新的、更安全的矩阵。我们希望他们能把错误的愤怒抛在一边，让矩阵成为一个和平的地方，也希望他们能够停止攻击全世界公民的日常生活。我们必须团结一致，在这段可能的黑暗时期里砥砺前行，从而登上更高的山峰。

感谢大家今天同我一起迈出这一步。让我们带着坚定的信念和不屈的意志继续前进。

Denver, FRFZ, December 1, 2074

Ladies, gentlemen, and entities of the Matrix, I come before you today with news that will forever change your Matrix experience. No longer will you need to fear the actions of lawless hackers and rogue AI’s. Never again will you feel fear when you open yourself to the digital universe to enjoy your latest sim in Hi-Def.

All of you were so kind as to accept this invitation to be the first to experience the new worldwide public grid, developed and hosted by a joint NeoNET and Mitsuhama Computer Technologies program. If you would all access the icon we offered to you when you entered.

While this program runs and assists your commlink in adjusting to the new protocols for this enhanced grid let me tell you what is to come.

No longer will our nodes be the playground of deviants. New protocols will detect and deny deviant behavior faster than ever before with the assistance and cooperation of all the members of the Corporate Court and their Grid Overwatch Division. Lawless hackers will now fear that GOD is always watching.

New Matrix structures will allow worldwide access without overloading individual and local resources by spreading the computing power of the public grid over the tens of thousands of substations, both terrestrial and in orbit. The new grids will be safer and stronger with an increased focus on pinpoint removal of trouble instead of node shutdowns needed during these recent years that have resulted in damage to innocents thanks to the thoughtless actions of deviants.

Grids will be overlapping and the public grid, available to everyone with even the simplest link or access device, will be augmented and enhanced by local, national, and corporate grids. Every member of the Corporate Court is already developing their own grid for their citizens and subscribers, while many of these companies—especially NeoNET and Mitsuhama—are in contract negotiations with local and national governments to develop grids with the new and safer protocols.

I see we have all successfully downloaded the new software. If everyone would please access the new grid using the complementary trodes, or their own hardware if it has been upgraded, and join me in the new public grid to continue this life changing endeavor. Security will ensure we are safe during our brief trip.

Welcome to the new WorldWide Grid! The first thing I would like to do is acknowledge DarPenChin as a demonstration that this new grid is not meant to exclude our technosentiences. Extensive studies have already been performed to demonstrate this new protocol is compatible with AIs, electrokinetics, and all other technosapients.

(Crowd Applause)

From this day forward, citizens of the world can access the Matrix and finally feel safe in this wireless world. The worldwide public grid is available now to anyone who downloads the new protocols. And in coming months, the member corporations of the Corporate Court will bring their grids online and connect to the public grid while offering additional services to their corporate citizens. Nations around the world will gradually roll out their grids in the beginning of the next year. By April 1, 2075 this new measure of security will be offered by nations and citystates around the world. We will enter a golden age of the Matrix where citizens of the world can communicate and connect with anyone, anywhere, and do so without fear of the deviant anarchist subculture of hackers preying upon them.

We stand on the precipice of a free and safe wireless Matrix. We take this leap together and shall soar to new heights.

But I warn that this coming change will not be entirely peaceful or without difficulties. The deviants will attempt to thwart this change. They will hire their shadowrunners and solicit Matrix gangs to terrorize the good people of NeoNET and MCT as they forge this new world. We must stand resolute against these foes and show them that we want a new, safer Matrix. We want their ilk to push their misplaced anger aside and leave the Matrix a peaceful place, and also to stop assaulting the daily lives of citizens around the world. We must all stand together and push forward during these possibly dark times to reach the enlightenment beyond.

Thank you all for joining me today and taking that step. Let us go forward with a strength of conviction and indomitable will.

丹佛，FRFZ，2075年1月1日

对于那些按照格里高利历法标记时间流逝的人来说，新年快乐。新年是变革的时刻，是决心的时刻，也是取得进步的时刻，因为我们要回顾过去的错误，并规划一个因过去而更加坚强的未来。这也是我今天向全世界发表讲话的原因。

我们长期生活在动荡不安的时代。尽管我们的文明和社会在各个方面都取得了重大进步，但仍有一些人认为有必要破坏进步。不管是出于对变革的恐惧，还是精神上的弊病，这些不合时宜的无政府主义者都无法应对进步，并试图破坏他人的自由。这就是为什么新矩阵设计了如此严格的安全协议。我知道很多人都说它们过于苛刻，但它们只会阻碍那些试图规避法律和秩序的人。有些人希望我证明旧矩阵为何如此危险，这就是今天我要对他们说的。

在过去的几个月里，我请来了世界上最优秀的头脑和最伟大的程序员为我收集关于矩阵滥用的信息。自从第二次崩溃和无线协议兴起以来，我们找到了许多替罪羊来承担我们的困扰。AIPS、超链者、AI和神话中的电子幽灵都曾在媒体的喧嚣中被指责为当今麻烦的罪魁祸首。但是这些群体是如此之小，而我们的矩阵又是如此之大，它们不过是扔进矩阵浩瀚海洋中的一粒沙砾。我们的麻烦海啸并非来自这样一个群体，而是来自于一个遍布全球的异类群体。这群人被称为黑客。

无论他们是可恶的暗影狂奔者还是勇闯黑暗、拯救光明的企业资产，他们都在攻击我们日常生活的代码和功能。他们的所作所为严重地破坏了旧矩阵的代码，以至于我们必须改变其根基。

我曾试图将我们的新矩阵作为变革和进步的种子传递出去，但媒体是无情的，他们每次广播都会把他们的问题推到全世界面前。因此，我现在要揭示艰难的真相。我们的进步不仅是出于进步的需要，也是为了在黑客的阴暗之心造成更多损害之前确保安全。

我知道问题不会因我的声明而结束，所以我会谈谈我的证据。来自世界各地的新闻都在报道了从纳米锻造到建筑项目的纳米技术失败。这些失败，我确信，是由黑客及其改变矩阵代码的变态行为造成的。他们程序的每次虚拟操作都会编码病毒，而这些操作正在不断累积。世界各地用于纳米体和纳米技术运作的敏感代码和通信都已经开始失效。

我不能保证这一改变能修复黑客已经造成的损害，但我可以向你们保证，新矩阵将阻止他们继续前进。我们将一起前进，夺回人类通讯史上最伟大的进步。我们会一起夺回属于我们的矩阵。

Denver, FRFZ, January 1, 2075

Happy New Year to those who mark the passage of time in the Gregorian tradition. A New Year is a time for change, a time for resolutions, and a time for progress as we look back at mistakes of our past and plan for a future built stronger for that past. And that sentiment is my reason for addressing the world today.

We have long lived in troubled times. Despite major advances in every aspect of our civilization and society, there are those who feel a need to destroy progress. Whether it arises from a fear of change or a mental malady, these anachronistic anarchists cannot handle progress and seek to destroy the freedoms of others. This is why the new Matrix is being designed with such strict security protocols. I know many have called them draconian, but they are only a hindrance to those who seek to circumvent law and order. There are those who want me to prove why the old Matrix is so dangerous, and it is to them I speak today.

During the past months I have had some of the world’s finest minds and greatest programmers gathering information for me on abuses in the Matrix. Since the second Crash and the rise of the wireless protocols, we have found many scapegoats for our troubles. AIPS, technomancers, AIs, and the mythical e-ghosts have all had their time in the media circus being blamed for the trouble of the day. But these groups are so small and our Matrix so big they are but a pebble-like disturbance thrown into the vast ocean of the Matrix. The tsunami of our trouble does not rise from a group like this but from a group of deviants that spans the globe. The group of people known as hackers.

Whether they be detestable shadowrunners or corporate assets who bravely step into the dark to save the light, they attack the code and the very functions of our day to day lives. They have so badly corrupted the code of the old Matrix with their efforts that we must change its very foundation.

I have tried to deliver our new Matrix as a seed of change and progress, but the media is relentless, and they push their questions in the faces of the world with each broadcast. So now, I bare the hard truths. We advance not only out of a need for progress but also out of a need for security before more damage is done by the dark hearts of hackers.

I know the questions will not end with my statements so I will speak of my proof. News from around the world speaks of failures in nanotech, from forges to construction projects. These failures, I am convinced, have been caused by hackers and their deviant actions that alter the very code of the Matrix with every illegal act. Their programs encode viruses with each virtual stroke, and those strokes have added up. The sensitive code and communication needed for nanites and nanotech to function has begun failing around the world.

I cannot ensure this change will repair the damage hackers have already done, but I can assure you this new Matrix will halt their advance. Together we move forward and take back the greatest step forward in the history of human communications. Together we take back our Matrix.
