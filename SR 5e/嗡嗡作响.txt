> 了解一家公司不仅仅是了解其领导层。这有助于你了解公司的文化，但在一个大公司中，有着数以百万计的员工，分布在数千个地点，划分为数百个部门和子公司，而身处顶层的人数却很有限。你会更频繁地遇到日常工作的普通员工而非领导层。当你闯入阿瑞斯的研究设施时达米安·奈特(Damien Knight)可不会坐在那里迎接你。当你潜入地平线的公关公司时，加里·克莱恩(Gary Cline)也不会负责那里的安保。因此，我们真正需要首先了解的是一线员工，也就是那些超企为了不断增长的利润而剥削的人，而这些人不知何故地说服自己接受了这一切。所以让我们深入了解一下超企工蜂的生活，看看是什么让他们运转。作为我们的指南，我们将使用《普吉特海湾》(Puget Sounds!)的一篇文章，这是一家数字报纸，出于某种原因，它模仿了上个世纪印刷报纸的风格。我们还将邀请一些了解卡尔(Karl)的嘉宾，正如你将看到的。阅读并享受吧！

> Understanding a corp is not just about understanding the leaders. That helps you see what the culture of the place might be, but in a megacorp you have millions of employees in thousands of locations divided into hundreds of divisions and subsidiaries, and only a handful of people at the top. You’re going to run into the day-today workers a whole lot more than the leaders. When you break into an Ares research facility, Damien Knight is not going to be sitting there to greet you. When you infiltrate a Horizon PR firm, Gary Cline won’t be working security. So the first group of people we really need to understand are the workers, the people who the megacorp exploits for their ever-growing profits, and who somehow convince themselves to be okay with this. So let’s take a deep look into the life of a corporate drone to see what makes them tick. As our guide, we’ll use an article from Puget Sounds!, a digital newspaper that for some reason imitates the look of a last-century print newspaper. We’ll also welcome in a few guests who got to know Karl, as you’ll see. Read on and enjoy!

[size=14pt][b]A DAY IN THE LIFE OF KARL DENISOVICH[/b][/size]

[size=14pt][b]BY RHONDA EHNDS[/b][/size]

[/spoiler]

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]苏醒[/b][/size][/color]

像往常一样，早上六点，卡尔·杰尼索维奇的公寓AI愉快地把他叫醒。但在这之后他们发生了争论。卡尔·杰尼索维奇睁开眼睛，直视着我们的编辑分配给他的小瓶妖(bottled imp)。您忠诚的记者将在一个小时内与他会面，但《普吉特海湾》想为您提供第一手资料。

卡尔住在皮阿拉普的一幢四十层公寓中，这是一套昂贵的500平方英尺的租赁公寓，专门为企业“工蜂”提供服务。卡尔是一名企业工蜂，尽管关于这个词是否符合政治正确还存在争议。一些AAA超企已经发起运动，试图阻止媒体使用这个词，但《普吉特海湾》是一份独立报纸。他们不喜欢什么对我们来说并不重要。

> 哈哈哈。这些所谓的“独立记者”让我感到好笑。你真觉得他们能在没有公司批准以及大概率存在的赞助的情况下进入卡尔的办公室？如果你这么想，我可以卖给你我的太空针塔，老兄。

> Cosmo

这就是他的生活。他生命中的某一天——而对于那些关心标签的人来说，卡尔对“工蜂”这个词感到满意。

“这是描述这种状况的恰当词汇，”他说。“而且确实是这种状况。我坐在一个小隔间里，淹没在许多其他小隔间之间。我们看起来就像个黄蜂工厂，只不过我们所处的房间是方形的而非六边形的。我小时候曾梦想长大后成为一名富积宇航员，你知道吗？”卡尔身高五英尺十英寸，年龄三十二岁，他的收入是公司工资的中位数。为你提供一些视角，这个工资是公司顶层收入的五十分之一以下，但它也足以供数十名西雅图无SIN者生活一年。您忠实的记者赚不到这么多钱。为了赚到这么多新元，他得做些什么呢？这就是一名工蜂生活的二十四小时的范例。也是你们大多数人没有去选择的那条道路。

> 我爸告诉我过去的新闻业曾经是“公正无私”的。我从没相信过他的话。我凭什么要相信？他还说，在他小时候，新闻主播都没有企业赞助商，我们都知道那纯属胡扯。见鬼，你甚至可以看到在奥利弗·奥尔特加(Oliver Ortega)前额上的阿瑞斯公司标志。

> Sounder

> 新闻报道从来都不是没有偏见的。它所面临的问题是如何处理这种偏见，以及要承认多少偏见。

> Sunshine

卡尔字面意义上地从床上翻滚而起，就好像这一天对他来说太难面对了。踩到硬木地板上后，他眨了眨眼，又抬头看了看天花板。他的订阅源接通了。

“阿拉斯泰尔(Alastair)，”他告诉公寓AI，“请给我来一杯豆咖。”

他的AI以令人担忧的平静与冷嘲热讽的语气回答说：“这个月你没能进入俱乐部，卡尔。一名新租户在投票中击败了你。”卡尔所在的大楼加入了一个名为“哥伦比亚醇香”的私人豆咖俱乐部，据说味道比你通常在豆巴克购买到的更像真正的咖啡。每个月，该共管公寓的租户都会匿名投票，决定谁能够获得这种咖啡。这些豆咖俱乐部只发放有限的会员资格，以保证它们的高档。

“他们为什么投我出局？”卡尔问，更多是对虚空发问而非对阿拉斯泰尔。

“你不太受欢迎，卡尔。老实说，你也有些懈怠了。公寓健身房记录显示上个月你只在里面待了六个小时。内部网络上的所有人都可以在投票时看到这一点。”

“我每周工作七十二个小时。”

“说真的，卡尔，拜托。每个人都每周工作七十二个小时。你有一张温暖的床，头上有一片屋顶，以及90.2年的预期寿命。”

“你听起来就像我父亲。”

我会为我们忠实的读者省略细节，但可以说卡尔和阿拉斯泰尔之间的对话演变成了一场争吵。在卡尔淋浴时，阿拉斯泰尔将水温调到了十摄氏度。没有豆咖(因为没意识到自己没能进入俱乐部，卡尔没有在家准备速溶豆咖)，但水温确实唤醒了他。顺便一提，今天早上我不得不在炉子上加热我的洗澡水。

卡尔穿上了纳米级培育棉质衬衫和沃尔玛-香港(Kong Wal-Mart)的领带——年轻高管系列。这在那些有一定抱负的工蜂群体中很受欢迎。忠实的读者，我相信你自己也有一条。<广告>

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]WAKING UP[/b][/size][/color]

As usual, at six o’ clock in the morning, Karl Denisovich’s apartment AI cheerfully wakes him. It isn’t until later that they get into an argument. Karl Denisovich opens his eyes, looking directly at the bottle imp our editor assigned to him. Your loyal reporter meets him in an hour, but we at Puget Sounds! want to give you the raw feed.

Karl lives in a forty story con-apt in Pulyallup, a pricey 500-square-foot rental that caters to corporate “drones.” Karl is a corporate drone, though there is some debate as to the political correctness of the term. Several of the Triple As have mounted campaigns to stop the use of the word in the media, but Puget Sounds! is an indie rag. What they don’t like doesn’t matter much to us.

> Hahaha. These “independent journalists” crack me up. You really think they’d get access to Karl’s workplace without corporate approval and, most probably, sponsorship? I have a Space Needle to sell you if you think that, chummer.

> Cosmo

This is his life. One day in his life-and Karl, for those of you who worry about labels, is fine with the term “drone.”

“It’s the right term for the condition,” he says. “And it is a condition. I sit in a cubicle lost among many other cubicles. We look like a wasp factory, except we’re square instead of hexagonal. I wanted to be a Fuchi astronaut when I grew up, you know?” Karl is five foot, ten inches tall, thirty-two years old, and he makes the median wage for his corporation. That wage is less than a fiftieth of what those at the top make, but it also could feed dozens of Seattle’s SINless for a year, to give you some perspective. Your faithful journalist doesn’t make this much. What does he have to do to take in that kind of nuyen?This is what tenty-four hours in a drone’s life looks like. This is the path most of you didn’t take.

> My daddy told me about the days when journalism was “unbiased.” I never did believe him about that. Why should I? He also said news anchors didn’t have corporate sponsors when he was a kid, and we all know that’s dragondrek. Hell, you can practically see the Ares logo on Oliver Ortega’s forehead.

> Sounder

> Journalism is never unbiased. What it struggles with is how to deal with the bias, and how much of it to acknowledge.

> Sunshine 

Karl literally rolls out of bed, like it’s too much for him to face the day. Once on the hardwood floor, he blinks and stares back up at the ceiling. His feed comes on.

“Alastair,” he tells the apartment AI, “soykaf, please.”

His AI is worryingly calm with a back tone of snide. “You didn’t make the club this month, Karl. A new tenant beat you in the vote.” Karl’s building subscribes to a members-only soykaf club called Scent of Columbia, which reputedly tastes more like real coffee than what you normally purchase at Soybucks. Each month, tenants of a given con-apt vote anonymously for who in the building gets access. These soykaf clubs only give out so many memberships. This keeps them exclusive.

“Why did they vote me out?” Karl asks, more to the universe than Alastair.

“You aren’t very popular, Karl. To be honest, you’ve also let yourself go. The building gym only has you logged for six hours last month. Everyone on the intranet can see that when they vote.”

“I work seventy-two hours a week.”

“Really, Karl, please. Everyone works seventy-two hours a week. You have a warm bed, a roof over your head and a projected lifespan of 90.2 years.”

“You sound like my father.”

I’ll spare our loyal readers the details, but suffice to say that the conversation degenerates into an argument between Karl and Alastair. Alastair then turns the water to ten degrees Celsius while Karl is in the shower. No soykaf (since he wasn’t aware about not making the building club, Karl hadn’t laid in any supplies of instant soykaf in his home), but the water temperature is a wake-up. I had to heat my shower water on the stove this morning, by the way.

Karl dresses in nano-grown cotton button downs and Kong Wal-Mart ties—the Young Executive line. These are popular among drones of a certain aspirant level. I’m sure you own one yourself, loyal reader. <barf>

许多时装设计师会去迎合企业的着装规范，而每个设计师都试图让自己的服装尽可能符合更多不同的着装要求。这样就诞生了一种乏味、毫无个性的产品，所有真正时尚的暗示都被手术化剔除了。这就是经过年复一年的复刻而提炼出来的经典西服，已经退化到了完全无法让人记住的地步。男士和女士的领带/结是唯一能体现他们个人风格的地方，尽管并非所有公司都允许打个性化领带，但那些允许打个性化领带的公司追踪到他们的员工工作满意度提高了0.08%。

Several fashion designers cater to corporate dress codes, each designer trying to fit an outfit into as many different dress codes as possible. This produces a bland, generic-looking product that has all hints of actual fashion surgically removed. It’s the classic suit as distilled through years and years of copies, degraded to the point of utter forgettability. Men and women’s ties are the only sartorial spot offering a touch of personal flair and, while not all corps allow personalized ties, those that do track a 0.08 percent increase in employee satisfaction while at work.

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]通勤[/b][/size][/color]

任何住在生态建筑外的工蜂都是通勤上班的。广告大力称赞西雅图的公共交通系统，但现实情况有些不同。卡尔的一天就是个很好的例子，充分说明了没提炒作和实际体验之间的认知失调。你有见过无SIN者精灵对着巴士后面的广告牌吐口水吗?

今天是《泛人类/人类工作权利法案》到期的第一天。该法案于昨日到期，市政府尚未对其进行更新。

罢工当然是非法的，但一些公交雇员已经鼓起勇气，在同一天使用了他们宝贵的病假。由于缺少司机，公交系统的运行速度有点慢，再加上今天似乎有很多行动缓慢的行人，他们在公交车前散步，让车辆无法完成它们的巡回路线。聪明的人认为，这些慢吞吞的行人中有些是请病假的公交雇员，在这个不允许实际抗议的地方进行某种形式的抗议，但没有证据能证明这一点。卡尔等了十分钟才等到一辆公交车。当公交车抵达时，一名兽人从车前穿过，然后停了下来，做出一副喘不过气的样子。那名兽人发现卡尔朝他这边看，瞪了他一眼。

“你有事吗？”兽人发问。

卡尔眨了眨眼睛。"并没有，老兄。" 他露出一丝微笑，正对着那名兽人，展现出他销售员的魅力。我看到了这一幕。卡尔和我本该十分钟前在地铁站台见面，但当他没有露面时，小瓶妖就告诉了我他的位置。一切都很顺利，我就是因为这个才在该死的白天起床。

那名兽人看起来已经准备好要打一架了。我给了他另一名记者的电话号码，告诉他如果想谈点什么就给她打电话。他不情愿地耷拉着脑袋离开了，他的LED在清晨的蒙蒙细雨中闪烁着。

卡尔为自己对新闻周期的疏忽表示歉意，然后我们走进了地铁。我让小瓶妖停留在我的肩膀上；如果卡尔想私下谈谈，它可能会派上用场。毕竟，我们已经获得了全部授权。为了你们，我打算充分利用这一点，我忠诚的读者们。

> 对对，“全部授权”，只要他们的老板在文章上签字就行。如果文章里有他们不希望出现的内容，你觉得它还能被刊登吗？不管你觉得自己看到了多少“工蜂的生活”，我向你保证，你看到的都是经过消毒的。

[spoiler]
[color=brown][size=14pt][b]THE COMMUTE[/b][/size][/color]

Any drone living outside an arc commutes to work. Advertising lauds Seattle’s public transportation system, but the reality is somewhat different. Karl’s day is a good example of the cognitive dissonance between the hype and the actual experience. You ever see a SINless elf puking in the back of a bus on the billboards?

Today is the first day of the expiration of the Metahuman/Human Jobs Rights Act. The bill expired yesterday and has yet to be renewed by the city.

Strikes are, of course, illegal, but some transit workers have summoned the courage to use one of their precious sick days all on the same day. The lack of drivers is slowing the system down a bit, plus there seem to be an inordinate amount of slow-moving pedestrians today, taking plenty of time to stroll in front of buses, keeping them from completing their rounds. The smart money says that some of these slow pedestrians are transit workers who have called in sick, demonstrating a form of protest in an area where actual protest is not allowed, but no proof of that has emerged. Karl spends ten minutes waiting for a bus. When it arrives, an ork crosses in front of it and then stops, making a show of huffing and heaving for breath. The ork sees Karl looking his way and shoots a glare back.

“Got a problem?” the ork asks.

Karl blinks. “Not me, omae.” He smiles, some of his salesman’s charm evidencing itself, aimed right at the ork. I see the scene go down. Karl and I were supposed to meet ten minutes ago on the metro platform, but the bottle imp 411’d me as to his location when he didn’t show. It’s all wiz, I only got up during fragging daylight hours for this.

The ork looks ready to tussle. I give him the alphanumerics of another reporter and tell him to call her if he wants to talk about anything. He grudgingly slumps away, his LEDs winking in early morning drizzle.

Karl makes an apology about his negligent attention to the news cycle, and we descend into the subway. I let the bottle imp rest on my shoulder; he might come in handy later if Karl wants to have a private moment. We’ve been granted all access, after all. I intend to take full advantage of that for you, my loyal readers.

> Yeah, “all access” so long as their corporate masters sign off on the article. You think it’d have even been filed if it had things they didn’t want included? No matter how much you think you’re seeing the “life of a drone,” I assure you, what you’re seeing is sanitized.

对于那些在过去三周进行媒体屏蔽的人来说，泛人类/人类工作权利法案在之前三年内禁止在西雅图使用自动驾驶公共交通工具。该法案一到期，联络公司就宣布与该市市政府重新签订了合同，并在所有公共交通系统上重新安装了更新后的软件。

[size=14pt][b]THE METAHUMAN/HUMAN JOBS RIGHTS ACT[/b][/size]

For those of you on a media cleanse for the last three weeks, the Metahuman/Human Jobs Rights Act forbade the use of self-driving public transportation in Seattle for the last three years. As soon as the act expired, Renraku re-asserted its contract with the city, and updated software was reinstalled on all public transit systems.

For those of you old enough to remember, a similar movement took place early in the century against the automation of taxis. We all know how that how that turned out.

[/quote]

“地铁的嗡鸣声与人体内分子的精确振动相同步。”卡尔告诉我：“在这里，你会感觉自己是这座城市的一部分，与这座城市共生共存。”他的每一句话都是对另外某种生活的渴求，尽管我认为他自己并没有意识到这一点。我们都会欺骗自己，就像公司欺骗我们一样。

“我想要一杯豆咖，”他说。当然，也有一些事实会渗透出来。

今早的通勤人潮仍然沉浸在他们的私人世界中。卡尔已经两次掏出了他的通讯链，但都在道歉后羞怯地将它收了回去。我告诉他要假装我不存在。“我们想要捕捉最原始的体验。”

“什么体验？”

“成为你。”

他不知道该作何反应，他的目光落在了地铁车窗上，上面挤满了广告和新闻。他的视线锁定了一个窗格，上面展示着关于塔科马解放阵线的故事。一名戴着黑色面具的精灵正通过变音器发言："在塔科马成为像丹佛一样的自由城市前，我们绝不罢休"。主播评论了上周在同一缔约城市发生的一起爆炸案。解放阵线宣称对此负责。世界上其他地方的新闻也在滚动播出，呈现出一连串多样化的琐事和恐慌。

我问卡尔是否对政治感兴趣，他摇了摇头，但算法很少犯错。然而，对像解放阵线这样的恐怖组织过于明显的兴趣可能会让一名工蜂被解雇。工蜂的生活致力于保持在一个狭窄的正常条形图内。异常会引人注目，并被要求进行绩效评估。

[spoiler]

“The thrum of the subway is something that synchs with the precise vibration of one’s own molecules. You feel symbiotic down here, a part of the city like you never do above,” Karl tells me. His every sentence is a plea to some other life, though I don’t think he realizes this. We lie to ourselves as much as the corps lie to us.

“I want kaf,” he says. Some truths, of course, seep through.

This morning’s commuter tide remains locked in the private world of their feeds. Twice now, Karl pulled out his commlink only to apologize and sheepishly put it away. I tell him to pretend I’m not here. “We want to capture the raw experience.”

“Of what?”

“Being you.”

He doesn’t know what to make of that, and his eyes find the subway windows crawling with adverts and news. His gaze causes one pane to lock, showcasing a story about the Tacoma Liberation Front. An elf in a black mask speaks through a voice baffler, “We won’t rest until Tacoma is a Free City, like Denver.” The anchor com-ments about a bombing last week in that same treaty city. The TLF claimed responsibility. The rest of the world scrolls by in the ticker, a multifarious litany of fluff and dread.

I ask if Karl is interested in politics and he shakes his head, but it’s rare the algorithms make a mistake. Yet, too overt an interest in a terrorist organization such as TLF could get a drone fired. The drone’s life is dedicated to staying within a narrow bar graph of normality. Anomalies stand out and are called up for performance reviews.

[size=14pt][b]目标市场营销[/b][/size]

典型的工蜂与暗影狂奔者截然不同。其中最关键的差异之一就是工蜂在其行走世界的过程中所留下的数据踪迹。

暗影狂奔者会竭尽全力地远离网络或巧妙地加以处理，而工蜂则依赖于这种无所不在的监控。地铁车窗扫描了卡尔的SIN，随后立即调出了一份与他兴趣相关的信息源。广告也是根据他的消费档案直接定制的。

数据公司不遗余力地追踪工蜂生活的细枝末节。企业不仅依赖于工蜂工作，还依赖他们购买商品。工蜂占据了百分之七十的消费市场。毕竟，有多少无SIN者能负担得起豆咖的订购费用？

每名工蜂都选择了为一家公司工作，并采用这种生活方式。有些人甚至花钱购买更好的个性化服务，这样他们就可以随时看到与自己相关的事物。工蜂从醒来到入睡的每一刻都受到追踪。先进的算法通过微调过滤器整合数据，筛选出一天中积累的无意义信息，以某种方式推断其目的并预测其未来行为。

尽管无所不在的监控是人们踏入暗影的众多原因之一，但这种追踪为狂奔者如何操纵工蜂提供了宝贵的线索。毕竟，在对某些体味除臭剂、电影类型、餐饮选择和暴食屋(Stuffer Shack)特价的偏好之下，隐藏着每名工蜂的全方位心理素描。一名碟客如果得到了这些信息，就拥有了许多马基雅维利式的对该主体内心的切入点。

[size=14pt][b]MARKETING TARGETS[/b][/size]

The typical drone is very different from a shadowrunner. Key among these differences are the data trails a drone leaves behind in their passage through the world.

Where a shadowrunner makes every effort to stay off of the grid or manipulate it when they go on, drones rely on such ubiquitous monitoring. The subway windowpane scanned Karl’s SIN and immediately called up a feed tailored to his interests. The advertising featured on this feed is likewise tied directly to his consumer profile.

Data companies go to great lengths to track the minutiae of a drone’s life. Corporations rely on drones not only to work but to buy. Drones make up seventy percent of the consumer market. After all, how many SINless can afford the nuyen for soykaf subscriptions?

Every drone opts in merely by working for a company and adopting that lifestyle. Some even pay for better profiling services so that they can always see things relevant to them. Drones are tracked from the moment they wake until the moment they go to bed. Advanced algorithms collate the data with fine-tuned filters, sifting through strata of accumulated meaninglessness of a day and somehow construing purpose and predicting future behavior.

While ubiquitous observation is among the myriad reasons people step into the shadows, this tracking provides valuable clues as to how a runner can manipulate a drone. After all, beneath the preferences for certain deodorants, film genres, dining choices and Stuffer Shack Specials lays a comprehensive psychological profile of every drone. A decker who gets their hands on these has a wealth of Machiavellian points of entry into that subject’s psyche.

卡尔看了看他的通讯链后深深地叹了口气。

“怎么了？”

“没什么。只是我哥。”

卡尔的哥哥和卡尔一样，本来是要过上公司生活的，直到两年前他从华盛顿州立大学退学，随后几乎彻底消失。卡尔时常能收到他那神秘且断断续续的短信。他的父亲总是担心。

“别在意，”他这样说，把通讯链放了回去，这时列车停下，两名来自某支街头帮派的皮衣小子上了车。

他们穿着的红色皮夹克在火车的白炽灯下闪闪发光。他们二人像狮子一样在车厢里游荡，视线在我们每个人身上扫过。随后他们盯上了坐在我们对面的一位小个子女性，开始骚扰她。

Karl takes a deep sigh after looking at his phone.

“What?”

“Nothing. Just my brother.”

Karl’s brother was, like Karl, on track for a corporate life until he dropped out of Washington State University two years ago and all but disappeared. Karl gets cryptic, and sporadic, texts from him. His father constantly worries.

“Never mind,” he says, putting the phone away as the train stops and two leatherboys from a go-gang get on.

Both of their red leather jackets shine under the train’s incandescents. They prowl the car like lions, eyes crawling over each of us. They settle on a smaller woman sitting across from us and start to hassle her.

Karl starts blinking rapidly, like some kind of allergic reaction. His hands twitch, but he doesn’t do anything. Karl, clearly, plays too many games. We’ve all seen this before, haven’t we, loyal readers?

[size=14pt][b]虚拟创伤障碍[/b][/size]

虚拟创伤障碍(VTD)是一种罕见的后天性疾病，类似于创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)，但完全是由虚拟体验引发的。尤其是游戏体验，会刺激大脑的某些区域，形成神经模式——就像在麦田里耕作的路径——这些路径在现实生活中会循环往复，而其中的一小部分被认为是“创伤性”的。

研究表明，退伍军人和VTD患者的大脑之间存在相似性。拉斯维加斯大学的梅尔-霍尔姆(Mel Holme)博士认为，这种障碍最常见于那些易于表现出战斗般行为或姿态的人。通俗地说，这位博士在理论上推断，少数VTD患者可能会成为出色的士兵。

> “可能会成为”？加美国已经研究这方面十年了。见鬼，他们发行了一些战斗游戏，正是为了招募士兵。你可以把这些游戏放到盖恩斯维尔的一些移动住宅、西雅图的贫民窟里，随后你就会找到一些潜在的精锐部队，他们的未来只有领取失业救济金……这还要看救济金是否已经满员了。超企也在关注这方面，尽管他们可以更挑剔一点。他们在较低级别的专业人员中招募人才。S&K公司专门制作了可以刺激文章中提到的大脑区域的游戏。可悲的是，只有大约百分之五的VTD患者能成为合格的企业部队和特工。这就意味着百分之九十五的人没有接受治疗就被抛弃了。S&K可不会为他们不计划雇佣和培训的人支付VTD的治疗费用。瞧瞧这个，狂奔者们。

[size=14pt][b]VIRTUAL TRAUMA DISORDER[/b][/size]

Virtual trauma disorder (VTD) is a rare acquired condition similar to PTSD but produced entirely by virtual experiences. Gaming experiences, in particular, excite certain regions of the brain that form neural patterns—like paths plowed in wheat fields—that loop back on themselves in real life situations. Some small numbers of these paths are considered “traumatic.”

Studies have shown a similarity between the brains of combat veterans and VTD sufferers. Dr. Mel Holme of Las Vegas University believes the disorder most commonly manifests in those prone to combat-like behavior or stances. In layman’s terms, the doctor theorizes that a small number of VTD sufferers might have made excellent soldiers.

> “Might have made?” UCAS has been on this for a decade. Hell, they put out some of those Brothers in Arms games precisely to find soldiers. You get yourself these games in some of the double-wides out of Gainesville, the slums of Seattle, and you find some potential crack troops with no future but the dole … and that’s if the dole isn’t full up. Corps are on to it, too, though they can afford to be a bit choosier. They recruit out of the ranks of the pros at the lower levels. S&K has a whole program devoted to making games that’ll specifically excite regions of the brain mentioned in the article. Sad thing is, only, like, five percent of the people who get VTD would make good corp troops and agents. That leaves ninety-five percent fragged without treatment. S&K isn’t going to pay to fix VTD for someone they don’t plan to hire and train. Scope that, chummers.

一些公司有自己的赞美歌，在企业用语中通常被称为“主题曲”。这些歌曲不可避免地是由某个落魄的B级作曲家编曲的。大多数员工对此不屑一顾，但企业文化中的这种特殊习俗却像虱子一样根深蒂固。

主题曲的整体意义可能微乎其微，但它却是企业操纵员工心理的冰山一角。公司希望他们的员工在工作时感到快乐，或至少认为自己很快乐。员工越快乐，工作效率就越高，而心理工程学在保证工蜂快乐方面很有一套。

Some corporations have hymns, more commonly called “theme songs” in most corpspeak. These are inevitably arranged by some B-list composer fallen on hard times. Most employees roll their eyes at such things, but the corporate culture has this particular custom ingrained like a tick.

The overall significance of the theme song is likely minimal, but it’s the tip of a vast iceberg of corporate psychological manipulation of their employees. The corps want their employees happy—or at least thinking they are—while at work. A happier employee is a more productive one, and psychological engineering is very good at keeping drones happy.

卡尔是"过着平静但绝望生活"的工蜂的例子，但他不应被视为典型。虽然许多工蜂无疑是不满意的，但更多工蜂享受着公司提供的安全保障。工作时间可能很长，但公司提供了各种福利——旅游和酒店优惠券或真正的假期、儿童日托、娱乐室、“娱乐时间”和许多其他进步性创新。这并不是说任何一个AAA公司不会在有机会的情况下割掉竞争对手的喉咙，只是说，排名靠前的公司往往拥有最先进的手段，即使不能让员工感到非常快乐，也能让他们心满意足。

奥尔布赖特是一名在企业阶梯上快速晋升的薪奴。她比卡尔年轻两岁，而且已经把这个部门——销售与客户维系部门——看成了自己的后花园。卡尔上一次的绩效评估并不差，他在部门里排在中等偏下的位置，但奥尔布赖特却特别不喜欢他，他是这么说的。在这一天的过程中，我发现他是对的。

赞美歌结束了，每个人都朝着他们分配到的公司地产的小隔间走去。卡尔试图随着人群一同散去，这让我想起了动物纪录片里的情节：羊群奔跑，狮子只能追到其中一只。今天卡尔就是那头不幸的羚羊。

“又迟到了，卡尔。”这不是提问。

“公交因罢工停运了。”他的声音非常微弱，有些心不在焉。

“每个人都知道罢工要来了。你应该早点出发。我给你的AI发了消息，他叫什么来着，阿尔伯特，因为我就知道你会忘记的。”

"你说什么？"

“我会在你的屁股上下咒，杰尼索维奇，让你的私处萎缩变小。”

“我的前任已经这么做了。”

她的眼睛眯了起来。她会找卡尔算账的，但不是今天。

卡尔又深深地叹了一口气——我已经习惯了——然后在他的新加坡产自动升降椅上坐了下来。他所在的公司——伟大美国产品公司——上个月被一家AAA公司收购了，虽然只是一次较小的收购，但对这家小公司来说却是一次重大变革。

母公司已经安装了这种刻有脉轮，灌注业力的新型按摩椅。他们找来了十几个法师，在东亚的丛林里挥舞鸡骨头和野猪肠子。至少扫描条形码时是这么说的。

“这把椅子，”卡尔告诉我，“是一系列变革的第一步。像我们这样的小公司被收购后，所有者不会一下子改变所有东西。在过去他们经常这样做。而这让员工们适应起来非常困难，他们称之为‘企业文化冲击’。这家历史悠久的公司曾让心理医生来处理一位员工的问题，他完全失去了理智，在休息室里裸露身体并自杀了。”

[spoiler]

Karl is an example of a drone living “a life of quiet desperation,” but he should not be thought of as typical. While many drones are no doubt dissatisfied, a great many more enjoy the security blanket a corporation provides. Hours may be long, but the company offers benefits— travel and hotel vouchers or real vacations, daycare for children, recreation rooms, “play time,” and many other progressive innovations. This is not to say any given AAA wouldn’t cut their competitor’s throat given the chance, only that the corporations on top tend to have the most advanced means of keeping their employees content if not happy.

Albright is a wagemage fast-tracked to promotion on the corporate ladder. She’s two years younger than Karl and already looking at this department—sales and client retention—in the rearview. Karl’s last performance review wasn’t abysmal—he ranked in the lower middle in his department—but Albright takes a special dislike to him, or so he claims. Over the course of the day, I’ll come to know he’s right.

The hymn ends, everyone trailing off to their given cubic meter of corporate real estate. Karl tries to scatter with the crowd, and I’m reminded of animal documentaries where the herd runs, and the lion only gets one of them. Karl is that unfortunate wildebeest today.

“Late again, Karl.” Not a question.

“The buses were shut down due to a strike,” his voice weak, his heart not in it.

“Everyone knew the strike was coming. You should have left early. I messaged your AI, what’s his name, Albert, because I knew you’d forget.”

“Sorry?”

“I’ll throw a hex on your ass, Denisovich, so your privates shrivel and shrink.”

“My ex beat you to it.”

Her eyes narrow. She’ll have her reckoning with Karl, but not today.

Karl takes another of his deep sighs—I’m getting used to them—and sits down in his Singaporean self-articulating chair. The company he works for—Great American Products—was bought last month by one of the triple-As, a minor acquisition, but a major change for the smaller corp.

The parent company already installed these new, massaging, chakra charmed, karma-infused chairs. They get mages by the dozen to wave chicken bones and boar intestines over them somewhere in the jungles of East Asia. At least that’s what it says when you scan the bar code.

“This chair,” Karl tells me, “is the first step in a host of changes. A smaller corp like mine gets bought, the owners don’t change everything at once. They used to, back in olden times. Got so bad for employees trying to adjust they called it ‘corporate culture shock.’ This ancient company had therapists come in to deal with an employee that totally lost it, exposed himself and committed suicide in the break room.”

[size=14pt][b]错配员工[/b][/size]

公司不仅会根据员工个人的需求，也会根据算法和法师的预测，为他们量身定制最合适的岗位。但有一小部分人，比如卡尔，会从缝隙中溜走，就像上层管理者所说的“错配”。

> 我们就是这样认识卡尔的——他是个“错配者”。其中一位招聘人员保存了一篇她认为是秘密的博客，我们找到了它。我用了一些混沌数学，筛选出了六个左右的候选人。

> Louis 3.14

错配员工可能会不开心，或者至少更有可能是不开心的。因此，如果你在调查一个部门，寻找一个可转化为资产的薄弱环节，那么不妨看看你是否能找到标有“错配者”这个人性化昵称的档案，或者你正在调查的公司使用的类似标签。

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]MISFILED EMPLOYEES[/b][/size]

A corp fits a person not only to what they want, but to what their algorithms and mages predict is the best position for them. A small number, like Karl, slip through the cracks and get, as upper management calls it “misfiled.”

> That’s how we first got on to Karl—he was a “misfile.” One of the recruiters keeps a blog she thinks is secret, and we sussed it out. I used some chaos math and filtered down to six or so candidates.

> Louis 3.14

Misfiles are likely to be unhappy, or at least more likely, so if you’re scoping a department for a weak link to turn into an asset, see if you can find files tagged with that humanizing little moniker “misfile,” or whatever similar label the corp your’re
investigating uses.

卡尔知道很多事情，即使我不是企业文化专家，也能看出他的才能可能被浪费了在销售与客户维系部门。然而，他应该在入职时就已经被筛选过了。他为什么会来到这里呢？

当被问及他在公司的目标时，卡尔说：“我曾经有雄心壮志，但最近我在想，这有什么意义呢？我想要奥尔布赖特的工作吗？我是说，那是怎么回事？对着人大喊大叫？我不想那样。”

卡尔是大学毕业后从戏剧专业深造中应聘来的，这不是典型的企业职业生涯轨迹。然而，2060年代的许多公司开始转向人文学科，试图改变陈旧的企业团队。人性化公司成为新的流行趋势，而卡尔是成千上万被这种新举措吸引的人之一。

这份背景为他赢得了一个实习机会，并最终在销售部门找到了一份工作。曾几何时，他的前途一片光明——他善于与人打交道，深受同事喜爱，并且超额完成了他的销售指标。在过去的几个月里，他的绩效评估开始下滑，直到卡尔的“员工图表”看起来就像强化奥运会的跳台滑雪一样——陡然向下倾斜。

他突然意识到自己可能说得太多了，但我向他保证，他所说的一切都会得到公司的批准。他不会受到惩罚。

“他们有其他办法制裁你。”又是一声惯用的叹息。“我需要一杯豆咖。”

我不知道他是否还记得那个小瓶妖今早全程收看了他的豆咖灾难。

[spoiler]

Karl knows many things, and even I, no expert in corporate culture, can see his talents are likely being wasted in Sales and Client Retention. Yet he would have been screened upon hiring. Why did he end up here?

When asked about his goals with the company, Karl says, “I used to have ambitions, but lately I think, what’s the point? Do I want Albright’s job? I mean, what’s that about? Yelling at people? I don’t want that.”

Karl was recruited out of college and from depths of a drama program—not your typical corporate trajectory. Yet many companies in the 2060s began turning to the humanities in an attempt to shake up stale corporate bands. Humanizing the corporation became the new fad, and Karl was one of thousands scooped up in this new initiative.

That background landed him an internship and, eventually, a job in sales. Once upon a time, his path looked clear—he was good with people, liked by coworkers, and exceeded his quotas. Over the last months, his performance reviews began to slip until Karl’s “employee graph” looked like the run up to a ski jump at the Enhanced Olympics—steeply angled downward.

He catches himself then, realizing he’s perhaps said too much, but I reassure him that everything he says is cleared by the company. He cannot be punished.

“They have other ways of getting you.” Another patented sigh. “I need a soykaf.”

I wonder if he remembers the bottle imp was watching his soykaf debacle this morning.

[size=14pt][b]图表化进步[/b][/size]

员工图表是可视化任何给定员工数据的内部方法。图表的大方向(向上或向下)以及倾斜或下降的程度，可以让管理者快速了解员工的过去表现和预期表现。

正处于上升期的员工不太可能屈服于暗影狂奔者的贿赂或威胁。然而，正在走下坡路的人则可以成为首要目标。卡尔·杰尼索维奇的档案将他标记为被淘汰者，但他仍然拥有公司权限。这一点值得利用。

作为一种冗余措施，许多公司开始限制那些图表不理想的员工的访问权限。因此，在狂奔者可以最佳化利用那些看似即将跌入谷底的员工之间存在一个小窗口时间。

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]CHARTING PROGRESS[/b][/size]

Employee graphs are an internal way of visualizing data on any given worker. The general direction of the graph, up or down, coupled with the degree of inclination or declination, gives managers a quick précis of an employee’s past performance and projected performance.

Someone on their way up is less likely to succumb to the bribes or threats of a shadowrunner. Someone on their way down, however, can make a prime target. Karl Denisovich’s file marked him as a dead-ender, but he still has corporate access. That is worth exploiting.

As a redundancy, many corporations began to restrict access for employees with less-than-optimal looking graphs. There is therefore a small window of time during which runners can best exploit an employee seemingly on their way to the bottom.

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]休息室[/b][/size][/color]

窗明几净。有如医院般的整洁，甚至会让人产生闻到了消毒水味道的错觉，但实际上能闻到的是从通风口送入的森林松木的清凉气味。这种气味很微弱，但只要集中注意力就能嗅到。这里就是休息室，有着相对宽敞的空间，墙壁上挂着与气味相同的松树林图片。隐约能听到小鸟啁啾的鸣叫声。

冰箱看起来就像是在郊区家庭中会看到的那样，但我知道贴在其表面的磁吸装饰品几乎没有真的。伟大美国产品公司与一家名为“FLARE”的瑞士设计公司签订了合同，让这些冰箱看起来就像家一样温馨。冰箱上有一幅画，似乎是小孩子画的——一个用黄色蜡笔画的太阳和火柴人外型的一家人。一张得到A评级的纸张略微歪斜着。在这些假装家庭的小饰品中，夹杂着一些官方的公司印刷品。他们使用这种过时的印刷品形式，也是因为这样更“人性化”。当然，冰箱可以按照主人的意愿展示出任意外观，但在这个案例中，其所有者希望唤起人们对上个世纪的回忆。

一个身材矮小的美籍亚裔精灵正靠在早餐室的角落里喝着可乐。当卡尔进来时，她紧张地有些坐立不安，就像女孩们在喜欢一个男孩时那样。

她是艾丽克丝·金(Alex Kim)，是华盛顿大学的应届毕业生，与卡尔一样，也是从人文学科——金的情况是社会学——应聘进来的。她负责汇编客户数据，并应用各种过滤程序，以最佳方式分类“激发购买欲望”的“热点触发器”。

“嗨，艾丽克丝，”卡尔说，我立刻意识到他并不知道这个女孩对他的吸引力。卡尔就像一枚导弹一样径直向咖啡机走去，但它却坏了。

“是多蒂(Dotty)，” Alex说。

“他们把它禁用了？”

“我告诉过你，他们不会让她像那样说公司的坏话，而我们都参与了。”

“我没有。”你甚至能听出一丝哀鸣。

“他们把这称为连带损害，卡尔。”她笑了笑，然后迅速把笑容藏到了汽水罐后面。

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]THE BREAK ROOM[/b][/size][/color]

Clean. Hospital clean, almost antiseptic smelling were it not for the cool forest pine odor pumped in via the vents. It’s subtle, but you can detect it if you focus. This is the break room, a relatively spacious area whose walls display the images of that selfsame pine forest mimicked in the air. Birds chirp faintly.

The fridge looks like what you’d see in a suburban home, but I know few of the decorations magnetized to its face are authentic. Great American Products contracts a Swiss design firm called FLARE to make these fridges look homey. There’s a picture seemingly drawn by a young child—a yellow crayon-squash of a sun and stick-figure family. A paper with an A grade is just slightly skewed. Among these faux-familial bits are official corporate printouts. They use the antiquated print form because, again, it’s more “humanizing.” The fridge can, of course, display whatever the owner wishes but, in this case, the owner wants to evoke the previous century.

A short, Asian-American elf is leaning on the corner of the breakfast nook, sipping a cola. She fidgets nervously when Karl enters, the way girls do when they like a fellow.

She is Alex Kim, a recent graduate of the U of W and, like Karl, recruited out of a humanities program—in Kim’s case, sociology. She compiles client data and applies various filter programs to best sort the “hot button” triggers” that make them buy.

“Hoi, Alex,” Karl says, and I instantly realize he is unaware of the girl’s attraction to him. Like a homing missile, Karl makes for the soykaf machine. It doesn’t work.

“Dotty,” Alex says.

“They took it away?”

“I told you they wouldn’t let her talk that way about the company, and we all joined in.”

“I didn’t.” You can almost hear the whine.

“They call that collateral damage, Karl.” She smiles, then quickly hides it away behind her soda-can.

[size=14pt][b]全视之眼[/b][/size]

当你加入一家公司时，你就默认接受了不间断的监视。大部分监控是如此隐秘，以至于根本没人能注意到，但他们都知道它的存在。事实上，如果没有这种监视，他们甚至会感觉到失落。

现代办公室到处都是各种微型摄像头，这也包括了员工的通讯链，主管和安保人员通常都可以访问。绝大多数摄像头都具有摄像和录音功能。从表面上看，这些措施是为了防止企业间谍活动。实际上，它们监听的是员工间的偶然对话。

任何对公司发表负面言论的人都会被记录下来。这些都会以密文代码的形式被归档到他们的员工档案中，并且会影响员工图表。虽然这种监视严格来说并不合法，但却很常见。

公司很少对这些员工采取直接行动，但会通过多种方式表达不悦。通常情况下，他们会通过例如强制加班、禁止访问某些矩阵区块，以及像卡尔遇到的拆除自动售货机或使饮料机失效等一系列方式来惩罚整个部门。

> 看看这个，欧梅。我和我的团队曾经在当地校园里发现了一个新无政府主义组织，他们故意参加公司的招聘活动，只是用纳米涂料破坏了该组织的内部，直到第二天才出现。不管怎样，我们偷偷塞给他们中的一个人一些新元来破坏自动售货机，这样我们就可以方便地去修理它，作为“官方第六世界可乐维修技术人员”。

我们在机器里安装了侦察装置，结果成功了。长话短说——我知道太晚了——员工们认为公司是在惩罚他们，第二天上班就发了一通病。哈。无人机需要好好整顿一下。

> 看看这个，伙计。我和我的团队曾在当地校园里发现了一个新无政府主义团体，他们特意混进公司的招聘活动，只是为了用直到第二天才会显现的纳米涂料破坏公司内部。总之，我们给其中一个人塞了些新元，让他把自动售货机弄坏了，这样我们就可以用“第六纪可乐官方维修技术人员”的身份进去修理了。

[size=14pt][b]ALL-SEEING EYES[/b][/size]

When you sign on with a corporation, you sign on for constant surveillance. Most of this is so passive that a drone never notices it, but they know it is there. In fact, if it weren’t, they might even miss it.

A variety of tiny cameras are all over the modern office— including in the employee commlinks, which supervisors and security typically can access. The vast majority of the available cameras have both video and audio recording capabilities. Ostensibly, these measures exist to prevent corporate espionage. In practice, they listen in on the incidental conversation between employees.

Anyone speaking poorly of the corporation is logged and noted. In a secret code, this is filed in their employee dossier and even affects the Employee Graph. While not strictly “legal,” this surveillance is nonetheless common.

Corporations rarely take direct action against such employees, though their displeasure is made known in a variety of ways. Often, they punish the entire department by creating mandatory extra hours, killing access to certain areas of the Matrix and, as in Karl’s case, removing vending machines or rendering beverage machines inert.

> Check this out, omae. My team and I once cottoned on to a neo-anarchist group on local campuses who purposefully got in on corporate recruiting tours, only to vandalize the insides of said corps with nano-paint that wouldn’t appear until the next day. Anyway, we slipped one of them some nuyen to break the vending machine, so we could conveniently come in and fix it as “official Sixth World Cola repair-techs.”

  We set up our recon inside the machine, and boy did it pay off. Long story short—too late, I know—the employees thought the corporation was punishing them and had a fit at work the next day. Heh. The drones needed a good shakeup.

卡尔看起来明显有些动摇，甚至有些泄气，就好像通向豆咖的最新障碍把他脚下的存在主义脚手架给推倒了。“多蒂，”他念叨着。

一个看上去寿命将尽的大个子兽人走了进来。他的灰白长发不符合公司要求。从外表上看，他是个新嬉皮士。你可以想象到他的样子，他的头发既长又染成了多种色彩，挥舞着旗帜反对当时的UCAS军事行动。

“乔治，”卡尔点了点头。

“是多蒂，”他说，怒视着豆咖机。“她太多嘴了。让我们都很难堪。”

艾丽克丝耸了耸肩。“我们也无能为力。真让人讨厌(Frag)。”说脏话不适合这位年轻的精灵。她说得就好像这个词里充满了最苦涩的柠檬味。

乔治笑了。"确实讨厌。你知道这个词是怎么来的吗？"

"当然，"艾丽克丝说，"以前的电子游戏。大家都知道。"

乔治摇了摇头。卡尔低声对我说，“现在我们要听历史课了”，但他听起来并不介意。

“大约一百年前，当时这里还是一个国家，他们和东南亚的另一个地方发生了战争。那些被派去的军队，呃，很多时候可以说是‘管理不善’。所以，如果遇到了一个让士兵送命的军官，他们就会在他的营房里安装一颗手榴弹。他们将手榴弹设置为陷阱，装在门上。当那个坏军官进来时，嘣！然后就再也没有军官了。”

乔治环顾房间，仿佛是在确保无处不在的摄像头都捕捉到了这一幕。他身材魁梧，即使在他这个年纪也很强壮。很明显，这是一种没人会认错的威胁。第二天，我被告知，豆咖机又开始正常工作了。

> 如果有人认为机器的修复与乔治的发言有关，那他们就太夸大工蜂的影响力了。

卡尔看了看通讯链。还有两个小时才到午饭时间。

"我只是想喝杯豆咖，该死"。他这么说着就走了出去。

"每个人都有自己的渴求，"乔治说。我看到艾丽克丝看着卡尔离开，她的脸颊因为我的目光而微微泛红。

[spoiler]
Karl looks visibly shaken, deflated almost, as if this latest barrier to coffee knocks the existential scaffolding from under his feet. “Dotty,” he says.

A large ork pushing his expiration date comes in. His long gray hair isn’t corporate approved. He looks, by all appearances, to have been a neo-hippie. You can imagine him, his hair just as long but full of color, waving flags against the UCAS military actions of his day.

“George,” Karl says and nods.

“Dotty,” he says, looking with ire at the soykaf machine. “She talks too much. Makes us all look bad.”

Alex shrugs. “Nothing we can do about it. Frag it.” Swearing doesn’t become the young elf. She says it like the word is laced with the bitterest of lemon.

George smiles. “Frag her indeed. You know where that term comes from?”

“Sure,” Alex says, “old video games. Everyone knows that.”

George shakes his head. Karl leans over and whispers to me, “We’re going to get a history lesson now,” but he doesn’t sound like he minds.

“About a hundred years ago, back when all this was a single country, they had a war with another place over in Southeast Asia. The troops they sent, well, they were what we’d call ‘under poor management’ much of the time. So, you get yourself an officer that’s getting the men killed, and they’d set a fragmentation grenade up in his sleeping quarters. They set it up trapped to the door. Your bad management type, he comes in and boom! No more officer.”

George looks around the room as if to make sure the omnipresent cameras are catching this. He’s big, and strong even at his age, and there is little mistaking this as anything but a threat. The next day, I’m told, the soykaf machine is back on.

> If anyone thought the restoration of the machine had anything to do with George’s talk, they have an overinflated notion of how much influence drones have.

> Cosmo

Karl looks at his phone. Lunch is still two hours away.

“I just wanted a soykaf, damn it.” He says and marches out.

“Everybody just wants something,” George says. I see Alex watch Karl as he goes, her cheeks flushing as her eyes catch mine.

原来，乔治的全名叫乔治·凯兹玛基·克莱恩，他参加了一些他之后抗议的UCAS战争。当他从那些战争归来后，他加入了新嬉皮士运动。为了那些懒得检索的读者，该运动宣扬通过矩阵的共享现实来实现和平。矩阵的早期支持者们非常理想化，相信共享网络会一直保持自由。把这些告诉你的朋友们吧，忠实的读者们。

在这场运动偃旗息鼓之后，乔治和其他许多人一样，找了一份力所能及的工作。有些人出卖了自己，转而加入了公司。

这些退伍军人拥有战术技能，而那些新嬉皮士天生就反对公司。当他们被雇佣时，筛选方法远没有现在这么先进，许多人都随着时间推移被淘汰了。

给聪明的狂奔者们一个建议：如果你能对这些人进行适当的甄别，你会拥有一笔非常有用的资产，甚至能让他们掩人耳目地做到一些事情。

> 这一点毫不夸张。你必须仔细筛选数据或者通过你的人脉来找到合适的退伍军人/新嬉皮士，但想找到一个就像找到一个非公司伪造的密码网站一样困难。

  然而，这些人大多都比较年长，要和他们玩花招是很困难的。我不在乎你自认为有多么狡猾，狂奔者，一个人到了七十多岁，他必然已经学到了一两件狗屎的事。坦率面对这些人通常是更好的方法。

[size=14pt][b]MORE ABOUT GEORGE[/b][/size]

It turns out George—full name George Kezmaki-Kline— fought in some of the UCAS wars he later protested. When he came back from those wars, he joined the neo-hippie movement. Said movement, for those of you too lazy to search, preached peace through the shared reality of the Matrix. Early proponents of the Matrix were idealistic enough to believe that the shared network would remain free. Tell that to your omaes, loyal readers.

After the movement fizzled, George, along with many others, took jobs where they could. Some sold out and went corporate.

These vets have tactical skills, and those who were neohippies are anti-corporate by nature. When they were hired, screening methods were not nearly so advanced, and many were simply grandfathered in as time passed.

A word to smart runners: If you scope these men and women properly, you could have a very handy asset that might even be able to cover their tracks.

> That ain’t no lie. You have to sift through the data or work your contacts to find the right vet/neo-hippie, but finding one is like finding a password site that isn’t a corporate fake.

  These fellows are mostly older, though, and it’s hard to put one over on them. I don’t care how slick you think you are, chummer, a man gets to be upwards of seventy, he’s learned a thing or two about bulldrek. Being upfront with theses types is usually the better method.

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]电话会议[/b][/size][/color]

房间是一个长长的椭圆形，中间是一张真正的红木桌子，该公司向我保证，这张桌子是根据原作克隆出来的。整个房间看起来就像一艘帆船的厨房，就是你在英国海军模拟游戏中看到的那种。部门里的大部分人都聚集在这里，每个人都戴着轻便、几乎看不见的远程呈现眼镜。

今天，会议在伦敦的特拉法加广场举行。你可以听到海鸥的叫声，它们柔软的白色背影就像广场铺开的一片雪地。那里有一座雕像，是那位海军上将——纳尔逊的雕像，眼镜上的说明是这么告诉我的——我认为这位CEO对十九世纪的海军情有独钟。

天空灰蒙蒙的，有时在普吉特海湾上空能看到的那种低沉忧郁的颜色。我从未真正去过伦敦，但它的第一印象很像西雅图，如果西雅图再过一千年的话。无论如何，天气似乎是一样的。我几乎可以嗅到空气中的雨味，虽然这些设备实际上没有气味模块。

一个穿着黑色西装的人大步走过广场，海鸥像被编排好一样突然成群结队地飞起。它们在上空盘旋着。这个人坚持让奥尔布赖特叫他艾迪，他是一个精灵，皮肤的颜色像浅色的拿铁咖啡。他特意与每个人握手，而会议室里的每个职员都佩戴了触觉反馈装置。

他甚至在我面前停下了脚步，用他的眼睛仔细观察我。“我知道你是我们今天的记者。我们的——”说到这里，他停顿了一下，显然是在看他终端上的显示屏“——卡尔就在这里。我再怎么强调都不为过，我们是多么依赖一线的人们。他们才是伟大美国产品公司的真正支柱。”他那优雅的口音和微妙的魅力几乎让我相信了他的话。

一小时后，会议变得有些拖沓。从会议室内其他浮动的目光来看，我并不是唯一一个感到无聊的人。然而，卡尔的眼睛却专注地盯着艾迪·辛格(Eddy Singh)先生。他看起来真的很投入，我认为他正在利用《普吉特海湾》提供的聚光灯，试图重启自己的职业生涯。直到当他皱了皱眉，露出微表情时，我才低头看向他的触觉设备，意识到他在玩游戏。我不知道他是如何在没有被察觉的情况下切入游戏的。他对企业AI的了解比我想象的要深。

艾迪·辛格喋喋不休地谈论客户关系和提供其他竞争对手所不具备的“无形品质”。他用了很多次这个词，“无形”。我的视线又回到了天空和那些在灰色天空中盘旋的海鸥。其中一只海鸥在特拉法加广场上空以更紧密的方式移动，就像一只正在游弋的掠食者。它发现我在看它，突然又回到了海鸥群中。这是怎么回事？忠实的读者们，我将稍后再详述。

埃迪·辛格继续谈论客户关系和提供其他竞争对手所没有的“无形品质”。他经常使用这个词，无形。我的眼睛又回到了天空和那些在灰色天空中旋转的海鸥。其中一只以更紧密的方式移动，就像特拉法加广场上方的游弋的捕食者。它看到我在看它，突然重新加入了飞行群。这是怎么回事？稍后会有更多详细内容，忠实的读者们。

Eddy Singh drones on about client relationships and providing that “intangible quality” other competitors do not. He uses that word a lot, intangible. My own eyes have drifted back to the sky and the whirling flock of gulls pockmarking the gray sky. One moves in a tighter pattern, a roving predator above Trafalgar Square. It sees me seeing it and abruptly rejoins the fold. What was that about? More on that later, loyal reader.

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]THE CONFERENCE CALL[/b][/size][/color]

The room is a long ellipsoid centered on what the company assured me is a real redwood table cloned from the originals. The whole room looks like it belongs in the galley of one of those sailing galleons, the sort you see in British Naval sims. Most of the department is gathered here, each wearing lightweight, nearly invisible telepresence glasses.

Today, the meeting is taking place in Trafalgar Square, London. You can hear the gulls, soft white backs like a carpet of snow across the square. There’s that statue there, the one of that admiral—Nelson, the glasses inform me with a caption—and I decide the CEO has a fetish for nineteenth-century naval kitsch.

The sky is gray, that downcast melancholy color you get over the Sound sometimes. I’ve never been to London physically, but the first impression is it looks a lot like Seattle if Seattle were a thousand years older. The weather, anyway, seems the same. I can almost smell the rain in the air, but these rigs do not actually have scent modules.

A man in a black suit strides across the square, and the gulls, as if choreographed, take off in a great shoal. They whirl above. The man, who insists Albright call him Eddy, is an elf with skin the color of a light latte. He makes a point of shaking everyone’s hand, the conference room crew having worn haptics.

He even stops at me, his eyes studying me carefully. “And I understand you’re our journalist for the day. A day in the life of our”— and here he pauses, obviously reading a display on his end—“Karl here. Well, I cannot stress enough how we depend on the women and men in the trenches. They’re the real backbone of Great American Products.” His posh accent and subtle charm almost make me believe him.

An hour later, the meeting is dragging. Judging by some of the other floating eyes in the room, I am not the only one bored. Karl, however, has his eyes locked intently on Mr. Eddy Singh. He really seems absorbed, and I think he’s using the spotlight Puget Sounds! provides to attempt to reboot his career. It’s only when he winces, a micro-expression really, that I look down at his hand in the haptics and realize he’s playing a game. I don’t know how he managed to insert it without detection. He knows his way around the corporate AIs better than I thought.

Eddy Singh drones on about client relationships and providing that “intangible quality” other competitors do not. He uses that word a lot, intangible. My own eyes have drifted back to the sky and the whirling flock of gulls pockmarking the gray sky. One moves in a tighter pattern, a roving predator above Trafalgar Square. It sees me seeing it and abruptly rejoins the fold. What was that about? More on that later, loyal reader.
