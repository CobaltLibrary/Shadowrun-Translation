> 了解一家公司不仅仅是了解其领导层。这有助于你了解公司的文化，但在一个大公司中，有着数以百万计的员工，分布在数千个地点，划分为数百个部门和子公司，而身处顶层的人数却很有限。你会更频繁地遇到日常工作的普通员工而非领导层。当你闯入阿瑞斯的研究设施时达米安·奈特(Damien Knight)可不会坐在那里迎接你。当你潜入地平线的公关公司时，加里·克莱恩(Gary Cline)也不会负责那里的安保。因此，我们真正需要首先了解的是一线员工，也就是那些超企为了不断增长的利润而剥削的人，而这些人不知何故地说服自己接受了这一切。所以让我们深入了解一下超企工蜂的生活，看看是什么让他们运转。作为我们的指南，我们将使用《普吉特海湾》(Puget Sounds!)的一篇文章，这是一家数字报纸，出于某种原因，它模仿了上个世纪印刷报纸的风格。我们还将邀请一些了解卡尔(Karl)的嘉宾，正如你将看到的。阅读并享受吧！

> Understanding a corp is not just about understanding the leaders. That helps you see what the culture of the place might be, but in a megacorp you have millions of employees in thousands of locations divided into hundreds of divisions and subsidiaries, and only a handful of people at the top. You’re going to run into the day-today workers a whole lot more than the leaders. When you break into an Ares research facility, Damien Knight is not going to be sitting there to greet you. When you infiltrate a Horizon PR firm, Gary Cline won’t be working security. So the first group of people we really need to understand are the workers, the people who the megacorp exploits for their ever-growing profits, and who somehow convince themselves to be okay with this. So let’s take a deep look into the life of a corporate drone to see what makes them tick. As our guide, we’ll use an article from Puget Sounds!, a digital newspaper that for some reason imitates the look of a last-century print newspaper. We’ll also welcome in a few guests who got to know Karl, as you’ll see. Read on and enjoy!

[size=14pt][b]A DAY IN THE LIFE OF KARL DENISOVICH[/b][/size]

[size=14pt][b]BY RHONDA EHNDS[/b][/size]

[/spoiler]

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]苏醒[/b][/size][/color]

像往常一样，早上六点，卡尔·杰尼索维奇的公寓AI愉快地把他叫醒。但在这之后他们发生了争论。卡尔·杰尼索维奇睁开眼睛，直视着我们的编辑分配给他的小瓶妖(bottled imp)。您忠实的记者将在一个小时内与他会面，但《普吉特海湾》想为您提供第一手资料。

卡尔住在皮阿拉普的一幢四十层公寓中，这是一套昂贵的500平方英尺的租赁公寓，专门为企业“工蜂”提供服务。卡尔是一名企业工蜂，尽管关于这个词是否符合政治正确还存在争议。一些AAA超企已经发起运动，试图阻止媒体使用这个词，但《普吉特海湾》是一份独立报纸。他们不喜欢什么对我们来说并不重要。

> 哈哈哈。这些所谓的“独立记者”让我感到好笑。你真觉得他们能在没有公司批准以及大概率存在的赞助的情况下进入卡尔的办公室？如果你这么想，我可以卖给你我的太空针塔，老兄。

> Cosmo

这就是他的生活。他生命中的某一天——而对于那些关心标签的人来说，卡尔对“工蜂”这个词感到满意。

“这是描述这种状况的恰当词汇，”他说。“而且确实是这种状况。我坐在一个小隔间里，淹没在许多其他小隔间之间。我们看起来就像个黄蜂工厂，只不过我们所处的房间是方形的而非六边形的。我小时候曾梦想长大后成为一名富积宇航员，你知道吗？”卡尔身高五英尺十英寸，年龄三十二岁，他的收入是公司工资的中位数。为你提供一些视角，这个工资是公司顶层收入的五十分之一以下，但它也足以供数十名西雅图无SIN者生活一年。您忠实的记者赚不到这么多钱。为了赚到这么多新元，他得做些什么呢？这就是一名工蜂生活的二十四小时的范例。也是你们大多数人没有去选择的那条道路。

> 我爸告诉我过去的新闻业曾经是“公正无私”的。我从没相信过他的话。我凭什么要相信？他还说，在他小时候，新闻主播都没有企业赞助商，我们都知道那纯属胡扯。见鬼，你甚至可以看到在奥利弗·奥尔特加(Oliver Ortega)前额上的阿瑞斯公司标志。

> Sounder

> 新闻报道从来都不是没有偏见的。它所面临的问题是如何处理这种偏见，以及要承认多少偏见。

> Sunshine

卡尔字面意义上地从床上翻滚而起，就好像这一天对他来说太难面对了。踩到硬木地板上后，他眨了眨眼，又抬头看了看天花板。他的订阅源接通了。

“阿拉斯泰尔(Alastair)，”他告诉公寓AI，“请给我来一杯豆咖。”

他的AI以令人担忧的平静与冷嘲热讽的语气回答说：“这个月你没能进入俱乐部，卡尔。一名新租户在投票中击败了你。”卡尔所在的大楼加入了一个名为“哥伦比亚醇香”的私人豆咖俱乐部，据说味道比你通常在豆巴克购买到的更像真正的咖啡。每个月，该共管公寓的租户都会匿名投票，决定谁能够获得这种咖啡。这些豆咖俱乐部只发放有限的会员资格，以保证它们的高档。

“他们为什么投我出局？”卡尔问，更多是对虚空发问而非对阿拉斯泰尔。

“你不太受欢迎，卡尔。老实说，你也有些懈怠了。公寓健身房记录显示上个月你只在里面待了六个小时。内部网络上的所有人都可以在投票时看到这一点。”

“我每周工作七十二个小时。”

“说真的，卡尔，拜托。每个人都每周工作七十二个小时。你有一张温暖的床，头上有一片屋顶，以及90.2年的预期寿命。”

“你听起来就像我父亲。”

我会为我们忠实的读者省略细节，但可以说卡尔和阿拉斯泰尔之间的对话演变成了一场争吵。在卡尔淋浴时，阿拉斯泰尔将水温调到了十摄氏度。没有豆咖(因为没意识到自己没能进入俱乐部，卡尔没有在家准备速溶豆咖)，但水温确实唤醒了他。顺便一提，今天早上我不得不在炉子上加热我的洗澡水。

卡尔穿上了纳米级培育棉质衬衫和沃尔玛-香港(Kong Wal-Mart)的领带——年轻高管系列。这在那些有一定抱负的工蜂群体中很受欢迎。忠实的读者，我相信你自己也有一条。<广告>

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]WAKING UP[/b][/size][/color]

As usual, at six o’ clock in the morning, Karl Denisovich’s apartment AI cheerfully wakes him. It isn’t until later that they get into an argument. Karl Denisovich opens his eyes, looking directly at the bottle imp our editor assigned to him. Your loyal reporter meets him in an hour, but we at Puget Sounds! want to give you the raw feed.

Karl lives in a forty story con-apt in Pulyallup, a pricey 500-square-foot rental that caters to corporate “drones.” Karl is a corporate drone, though there is some debate as to the political correctness of the term. Several of the Triple As have mounted campaigns to stop the use of the word in the media, but Puget Sounds! is an indie rag. What they don’t like doesn’t matter much to us.

> Hahaha. These “independent journalists” crack me up. You really think they’d get access to Karl’s workplace without corporate approval and, most probably, sponsorship? I have a Space Needle to sell you if you think that, chummer.

> Cosmo

This is his life. One day in his life-and Karl, for those of you who worry about labels, is fine with the term “drone.”

“It’s the right term for the condition,” he says. “And it is a condition. I sit in a cubicle lost among many other cubicles. We look like a wasp factory, except we’re square instead of hexagonal. I wanted to be a Fuchi astronaut when I grew up, you know?” Karl is five foot, ten inches tall, thirty-two years old, and he makes the median wage for his corporation. That wage is less than a fiftieth of what those at the top make, but it also could feed dozens of Seattle’s SINless for a year, to give you some perspective. Your faithful journalist doesn’t make this much. What does he have to do to take in that kind of nuyen?This is what tenty-four hours in a drone’s life looks like. This is the path most of you didn’t take.

> My daddy told me about the days when journalism was “unbiased.” I never did believe him about that. Why should I? He also said news anchors didn’t have corporate sponsors when he was a kid, and we all know that’s dragondrek. Hell, you can practically see the Ares logo on Oliver Ortega’s forehead.

> Sounder

> Journalism is never unbiased. What it struggles with is how to deal with the bias, and how much of it to acknowledge.

> Sunshine 

Karl literally rolls out of bed, like it’s too much for him to face the day. Once on the hardwood floor, he blinks and stares back up at the ceiling. His feed comes on.

“Alastair,” he tells the apartment AI, “soykaf, please.”

His AI is worryingly calm with a back tone of snide. “You didn’t make the club this month, Karl. A new tenant beat you in the vote.” Karl’s building subscribes to a members-only soykaf club called Scent of Columbia, which reputedly tastes more like real coffee than what you normally purchase at Soybucks. Each month, tenants of a given con-apt vote anonymously for who in the building gets access. These soykaf clubs only give out so many memberships. This keeps them exclusive.

“Why did they vote me out?” Karl asks, more to the universe than Alastair.

“You aren’t very popular, Karl. To be honest, you’ve also let yourself go. The building gym only has you logged for six hours last month. Everyone on the intranet can see that when they vote.”

“I work seventy-two hours a week.”

“Really, Karl, please. Everyone works seventy-two hours a week. You have a warm bed, a roof over your head and a projected lifespan of 90.2 years.”

“You sound like my father.”

I’ll spare our loyal readers the details, but suffice to say that the conversation degenerates into an argument between Karl and Alastair. Alastair then turns the water to ten degrees Celsius while Karl is in the shower. No soykaf (since he wasn’t aware about not making the building club, Karl hadn’t laid in any supplies of instant soykaf in his home), but the water temperature is a wake-up. I had to heat my shower water on the stove this morning, by the way.

Karl dresses in nano-grown cotton button downs and Kong Wal-Mart ties—the Young Executive line. These are popular among drones of a certain aspirant level. I’m sure you own one yourself, loyal reader. <barf>

许多时装设计师会去迎合企业的着装规范，而每个设计师都试图让自己的服装尽可能符合更多不同的着装要求。这样就诞生了一种乏味、毫无个性的产品，所有真正时尚的暗示都被手术化剔除了。这就是经过年复一年的复刻而提炼出来的经典西服，已经退化到了完全无法让人记住的地步。男士和女士的领带/结是唯一能体现他们个人风格的地方，尽管并非所有公司都允许打个性化领带，但那些允许打个性化领带的公司追踪到他们的员工工作满意度提高了0.08%。

Several fashion designers cater to corporate dress codes, each designer trying to fit an outfit into as many different dress codes as possible. This produces a bland, generic-looking product that has all hints of actual fashion surgically removed. It’s the classic suit as distilled through years and years of copies, degraded to the point of utter forgettability. Men and women’s ties are the only sartorial spot offering a touch of personal flair and, while not all corps allow personalized ties, those that do track a 0.08 percent increase in employee satisfaction while at work.

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]通勤[/b][/size][/color]

任何住在生态建筑外的工蜂都是通勤上班的。广告大力称赞西雅图的公共交通系统，但现实情况有些不同。卡尔的一天就是个很好的例子，充分说明了媒体炒作和实际体验之间的认知失调。你有见过无SIN者精灵对着巴士后面的广告牌吐口水吗?

今天是《泛人类/人类工作权利法案》到期的第一天。该法案于昨日到期，市政府尚未对其进行更新。

罢工当然是非法的，但一些公交雇员已经鼓起勇气，在同一天使用了他们宝贵的病假。由于缺少司机，公交系统的运行速度有点慢，再加上今天似乎有很多行动缓慢的行人，他们在公交车前散步，让车辆无法完成它们的巡回路线。聪明的人认为，这些慢吞吞的行人中有些是请病假的公交雇员，在这个不允许实际抗议的地方进行某种形式的抗议，但没有证据能证明这一点。卡尔等了十分钟才等到一辆公交车。当公交车抵达时，一名兽人从车前穿过，然后停了下来，做出一副喘不过气的样子。那名兽人发现卡尔朝他这边看，瞪了他一眼。

“你有事吗？”兽人发问。

卡尔眨了眨眼睛。"并没有，老兄。" 他露出一丝微笑，正对着那名兽人，展现出他销售员的魅力。我看到了这一幕。卡尔和我本该十分钟前在地铁站台见面，但当他没有露面时，小瓶妖就告诉了我他的位置。一切都很顺利，我就是因为这个才在该死的白天起床。

那名兽人看起来已经准备好要打一架了。我给了他另一名记者的电话号码，告诉他如果想谈点什么就给她打电话。他不情愿地耷拉着脑袋离开了，他的LED在清晨的蒙蒙细雨中闪烁着。

卡尔为自己对新闻周期的疏忽表示歉意，然后我们走进了地铁。我让小瓶妖停留在我的肩膀上；如果卡尔想私下谈谈，它可能会派上用场。毕竟，我们已经获得了全部授权。为了你们，我打算充分利用这一点，我忠诚的读者们。

> 对对，“全部授权”，只要他们的老板在文章上签字就行。如果文章里有他们不希望出现的内容，你觉得它还能被刊登吗？不管你觉得自己看到了多少“工蜂的生活”，我向你保证，你看到的都是经过消毒的。

[spoiler]
[color=brown][size=14pt][b]THE COMMUTE[/b][/size][/color]

Any drone living outside an arc commutes to work. Advertising lauds Seattle’s public transportation system, but the reality is somewhat different. Karl’s day is a good example of the cognitive dissonance between the hype and the actual experience. You ever see a SINless elf puking in the back of a bus on the billboards?

Today is the first day of the expiration of the Metahuman/Human Jobs Rights Act. The bill expired yesterday and has yet to be renewed by the city.

Strikes are, of course, illegal, but some transit workers have summoned the courage to use one of their precious sick days all on the same day. The lack of drivers is slowing the system down a bit, plus there seem to be an inordinate amount of slow-moving pedestrians today, taking plenty of time to stroll in front of buses, keeping them from completing their rounds. The smart money says that some of these slow pedestrians are transit workers who have called in sick, demonstrating a form of protest in an area where actual protest is not allowed, but no proof of that has emerged. Karl spends ten minutes waiting for a bus. When it arrives, an ork crosses in front of it and then stops, making a show of huffing and heaving for breath. The ork sees Karl looking his way and shoots a glare back.

“Got a problem?” the ork asks.

Karl blinks. “Not me, omae.” He smiles, some of his salesman’s charm evidencing itself, aimed right at the ork. I see the scene go down. Karl and I were supposed to meet ten minutes ago on the metro platform, but the bottle imp 411’d me as to his location when he didn’t show. It’s all wiz, I only got up during fragging daylight hours for this.

The ork looks ready to tussle. I give him the alphanumerics of another reporter and tell him to call her if he wants to talk about anything. He grudgingly slumps away, his LEDs winking in early morning drizzle.

Karl makes an apology about his negligent attention to the news cycle, and we descend into the subway. I let the bottle imp rest on my shoulder; he might come in handy later if Karl wants to have a private moment. We’ve been granted all access, after all. I intend to take full advantage of that for you, my loyal readers.

> Yeah, “all access” so long as their corporate masters sign off on the article. You think it’d have even been filed if it had things they didn’t want included? No matter how much you think you’re seeing the “life of a drone,” I assure you, what you’re seeing is sanitized.

对于那些在过去三周进行媒体屏蔽的人来说，泛人类/人类工作权利法案在之前三年内禁止在西雅图使用自动驾驶公共交通工具。该法案一到期，联络公司就宣布与该市市政府重新签订了合同，并在所有公共交通系统上重新安装了更新后的软件。

[size=14pt][b]THE METAHUMAN/HUMAN JOBS RIGHTS ACT[/b][/size]

For those of you on a media cleanse for the last three weeks, the Metahuman/Human Jobs Rights Act forbade the use of self-driving public transportation in Seattle for the last three years. As soon as the act expired, Renraku re-asserted its contract with the city, and updated software was reinstalled on all public transit systems.

For those of you old enough to remember, a similar movement took place early in the century against the automation of taxis. We all know how that how that turned out.

[/quote]

“地铁的嗡鸣声与人体内分子的精确振动相同步。”卡尔告诉我：“在这里，你会感觉自己是这座城市的一部分，与这座城市共生共存。”他的每一句话都是对另外某种生活的渴求，尽管我认为他自己并没有意识到这一点。我们都会欺骗自己，就像公司欺骗我们一样。

“我想要一杯豆咖，”他说。当然，也有一些事实会渗透出来。

今早的通勤人潮仍然沉浸在他们的私人世界中。卡尔已经两次掏出了他的通讯链，但都在道歉后羞怯地将它收了回去。我告诉他要假装我不存在。“我们想要捕捉最原始的体验。”

“什么体验？”

“成为你。”

他不知道该作何反应，他的目光落在了地铁车窗上，上面挤满了广告和新闻。他的视线锁定了一个窗格，上面展示着关于塔科马解放阵线的故事。一名戴着黑色面具的精灵正通过变音器发言："在塔科马成为像丹佛一样的自由城市前，我们绝不罢休"。主播评论了上周在同一缔约城市发生的一起爆炸案。解放阵线宣称对此负责。世界上其他地方的新闻也在滚动播出，呈现出一连串多样化的琐事和恐慌。

我问卡尔是否对政治感兴趣，他摇了摇头，但算法很少犯错。然而，对像解放阵线这样的恐怖组织过于明显的兴趣可能会让一名工蜂被解雇。工蜂的生活致力于保持在一个狭窄的正常条形图内。异常会引人注目，并被要求进行绩效评估。

[spoiler]

“The thrum of the subway is something that synchs with the precise vibration of one’s own molecules. You feel symbiotic down here, a part of the city like you never do above,” Karl tells me. His every sentence is a plea to some other life, though I don’t think he realizes this. We lie to ourselves as much as the corps lie to us.

“I want kaf,” he says. Some truths, of course, seep through.

This morning’s commuter tide remains locked in the private world of their feeds. Twice now, Karl pulled out his commlink only to apologize and sheepishly put it away. I tell him to pretend I’m not here. “We want to capture the raw experience.”

“Of what?”

“Being you.”

He doesn’t know what to make of that, and his eyes find the subway windows crawling with adverts and news. His gaze causes one pane to lock, showcasing a story about the Tacoma Liberation Front. An elf in a black mask speaks through a voice baffler, “We won’t rest until Tacoma is a Free City, like Denver.” The anchor com-ments about a bombing last week in that same treaty city. The TLF claimed responsibility. The rest of the world scrolls by in the ticker, a multifarious litany of fluff and dread.

I ask if Karl is interested in politics and he shakes his head, but it’s rare the algorithms make a mistake. Yet, too overt an interest in a terrorist organization such as TLF could get a drone fired. The drone’s life is dedicated to staying within a narrow bar graph of normality. Anomalies stand out and are called up for performance reviews.

[size=14pt][b]目标市场营销[/b][/size]

典型的工蜂与暗影狂奔者截然不同。其中最关键的差异之一就是工蜂在其行走世界的过程中所留下的数据踪迹。

暗影狂奔者会竭尽全力地远离网络或巧妙地加以处理，而工蜂则依赖于这种无所不在的监控。地铁车窗扫描了卡尔的SIN，随后立即调出了一份与他兴趣相关的信息源。广告也是根据他的消费档案直接定制的。

数据公司不遗余力地追踪工蜂生活的细枝末节。企业不仅依赖于工蜂工作，还依赖他们购买商品。工蜂占据了百分之七十的消费市场。毕竟，有多少无SIN者能负担得起豆咖的订购费用？

每名工蜂都选择了为一家公司工作，并采用这种生活方式。有些人甚至花钱购买更好的个性化服务，这样他们就可以随时看到与自己相关的事物。工蜂从醒来到入睡的每一刻都受到追踪。先进的算法通过微调过滤器整合数据，筛选出一天中积累的无意义信息，以某种方式推断其目的并预测其未来行为。

尽管无所不在的监控是人们踏入暗影的众多原因之一，但这种追踪为狂奔者如何操纵工蜂提供了宝贵的线索。毕竟，在对某些体味除臭剂、电影类型、餐饮选择和暴食屋(Stuffer Shack)特价的偏好之下，隐藏着每名工蜂的全方位心理素描。一名碟客如果得到了这些信息，就拥有了许多马基雅维利式的对该主体内心的切入点。

[size=14pt][b]MARKETING TARGETS[/b][/size]

The typical drone is very different from a shadowrunner. Key among these differences are the data trails a drone leaves behind in their passage through the world.

Where a shadowrunner makes every effort to stay off of the grid or manipulate it when they go on, drones rely on such ubiquitous monitoring. The subway windowpane scanned Karl’s SIN and immediately called up a feed tailored to his interests. The advertising featured on this feed is likewise tied directly to his consumer profile.

Data companies go to great lengths to track the minutiae of a drone’s life. Corporations rely on drones not only to work but to buy. Drones make up seventy percent of the consumer market. After all, how many SINless can afford the nuyen for soykaf subscriptions?

Every drone opts in merely by working for a company and adopting that lifestyle. Some even pay for better profiling services so that they can always see things relevant to them. Drones are tracked from the moment they wake until the moment they go to bed. Advanced algorithms collate the data with fine-tuned filters, sifting through strata of accumulated meaninglessness of a day and somehow construing purpose and predicting future behavior.

While ubiquitous observation is among the myriad reasons people step into the shadows, this tracking provides valuable clues as to how a runner can manipulate a drone. After all, beneath the preferences for certain deodorants, film genres, dining choices and Stuffer Shack Specials lays a comprehensive psychological profile of every drone. A decker who gets their hands on these has a wealth of Machiavellian points of entry into that subject’s psyche.

卡尔看了看他的通讯链后深深地叹了口气。

“怎么了？”

“没什么。只是我哥。”

卡尔的哥哥和卡尔一样，本来是要过上公司生活的，直到两年前他从华盛顿州立大学退学，随后几乎彻底消失。卡尔时常能收到他那神秘且断断续续的短信。他的父亲总是担心。

“别在意，”他这样说，把通讯链放了回去，这时列车停下，两名来自某支街头帮派的皮衣小子上了车。

他们穿着的红色皮夹克在火车的白炽灯下闪闪发光。他们二人像狮子一样在车厢里游荡，视线在我们每个人身上扫过。随后他们盯上了坐在我们对面的一位小个子女性，开始骚扰她。

Karl takes a deep sigh after looking at his phone.

“What?”

“Nothing. Just my brother.”

Karl’s brother was, like Karl, on track for a corporate life until he dropped out of Washington State University two years ago and all but disappeared. Karl gets cryptic, and sporadic, texts from him. His father constantly worries.

“Never mind,” he says, putting the phone away as the train stops and two leatherboys from a go-gang get on.

Both of their red leather jackets shine under the train’s incandescents. They prowl the car like lions, eyes crawling over each of us. They settle on a smaller woman sitting across from us and start to hassle her.

Karl starts blinking rapidly, like some kind of allergic reaction. His hands twitch, but he doesn’t do anything. Karl, clearly, plays too many games. We’ve all seen this before, haven’t we, loyal readers?

[size=14pt][b]虚拟创伤障碍[/b][/size]

虚拟创伤障碍(VTD)是一种罕见的后天性疾病，类似于创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)，但完全是由虚拟体验引发的。尤其是游戏体验，会刺激大脑的某些区域，形成神经模式——就像在麦田里耕作的路径——这些路径在现实生活中会循环往复，而其中的一小部分被认为是“创伤性”的。

研究表明，退伍军人和VTD患者的大脑之间存在相似性。拉斯维加斯大学的梅尔-霍尔姆(Mel Holme)博士认为，这种障碍最常见于那些易于表现出战斗般行为或姿态的人。通俗地说，这位博士在理论上推断，少数VTD患者可能会成为出色的士兵。

> “可能会成为”？加美国已经研究这方面十年了。见鬼，他们发行了一些战斗游戏，正是为了招募士兵。你可以把这些游戏放到盖恩斯维尔的一些移动住宅、西雅图的贫民窟里，随后你就会找到一些潜在的精锐部队，他们的未来只有领取失业救济金……这还要看救济金是否已经满员了。超企也在关注这方面，尽管他们可以更挑剔一点。他们在较低级别的专业人员中招募人才。S&K公司专门制作了可以刺激文章中提到的大脑区域的游戏。可悲的是，只有大约百分之五的VTD患者能成为合格的企业部队和特工。这就意味着百分之九十五的人没有接受治疗就被抛弃了。S&K可不会为他们不计划雇佣和培训的人支付VTD的治疗费用。瞧瞧这个，狂奔者们。

[size=14pt][b]VIRTUAL TRAUMA DISORDER[/b][/size]

Virtual trauma disorder (VTD) is a rare acquired condition similar to PTSD but produced entirely by virtual experiences. Gaming experiences, in particular, excite certain regions of the brain that form neural patterns—like paths plowed in wheat fields—that loop back on themselves in real life situations. Some small numbers of these paths are considered “traumatic.”

Studies have shown a similarity between the brains of combat veterans and VTD sufferers. Dr. Mel Holme of Las Vegas University believes the disorder most commonly manifests in those prone to combat-like behavior or stances. In layman’s terms, the doctor theorizes that a small number of VTD sufferers might have made excellent soldiers.

> “Might have made?” UCAS has been on this for a decade. Hell, they put out some of those Brothers in Arms games precisely to find soldiers. You get yourself these games in some of the double-wides out of Gainesville, the slums of Seattle, and you find some potential crack troops with no future but the dole … and that’s if the dole isn’t full up. Corps are on to it, too, though they can afford to be a bit choosier. They recruit out of the ranks of the pros at the lower levels. S&K has a whole program devoted to making games that’ll specifically excite regions of the brain mentioned in the article. Sad thing is, only, like, five percent of the people who get VTD would make good corp troops and agents. That leaves ninety-five percent fragged without treatment. S&K isn’t going to pay to fix VTD for someone they don’t plan to hire and train. Scope that, chummers.

一些公司有自己的赞美歌，在企业用语中通常被称为“主题曲”。这些歌曲不可避免地是由某个落魄的B级作曲家编曲的。大多数员工对此不屑一顾，但企业文化中的这种特殊习俗却像虱子一样根深蒂固。

主题曲的整体意义可能微乎其微，但它却是企业操纵员工心理的冰山一角。公司希望他们的员工在工作时感到快乐，或至少认为自己很快乐。员工越快乐，工作效率就越高，而心理工程学在保证工蜂快乐方面很有一套。

Some corporations have hymns, more commonly called “theme songs” in most corpspeak. These are inevitably arranged by some B-list composer fallen on hard times. Most employees roll their eyes at such things, but the corporate culture has this particular custom ingrained like a tick.

The overall significance of the theme song is likely minimal, but it’s the tip of a vast iceberg of corporate psychological manipulation of their employees. The corps want their employees happy—or at least thinking they are—while at work. A happier employee is a more productive one, and psychological engineering is very good at keeping drones happy.

卡尔是"过着平静但绝望生活"的工蜂的例子，但他不应被视为典型。虽然许多工蜂无疑是不满意的，但更多工蜂享受着公司提供的安全保障。工作时间可能很长，但公司提供了各种福利——旅游和酒店优惠券或真正的假期、儿童日托、娱乐室、“娱乐时间”和许多其他进步性创新。这并不是说任何一个AAA公司不会在有机会的情况下割掉竞争对手的喉咙，只是说，排名靠前的公司往往拥有最先进的手段，即使不能让员工感到非常快乐，也能让他们心满意足。

奥尔布赖特是一名在企业阶梯上快速晋升的薪奴。她比卡尔年轻两岁，而且已经把这个部门——销售与客户维系部门——看成了自己的后花园。卡尔上一次的绩效评估并不差，他在部门里排在中等偏下的位置，但奥尔布赖特却特别不喜欢他，他是这么说的。在这一天的过程中，我发现他是对的。

赞美歌结束了，每个人都朝着他们分配到的公司地产的小隔间走去。卡尔试图随着人群一同散去，这让我想起了动物纪录片里的情节：羊群奔跑，狮子只能追到其中一只。今天卡尔就是那头不幸的羚羊。

“又迟到了，卡尔。”这不是提问。

“公交因罢工停运了。”他的声音非常微弱，有些心不在焉。

“每个人都知道罢工要来了。你应该早点出发。我给你的AI发了消息，他叫什么来着，阿尔伯特，因为我就知道你会忘记的。”

"你说什么？"

“我会在你的屁股上下咒，杰尼索维奇，让你的私处萎缩变小。”

“我的前任已经这么做了。”

她的眼睛眯了起来。她会找卡尔算账的，但不是今天。

卡尔又深深地叹了一口气——我已经习惯了——然后在他的新加坡产自动升降椅上坐了下来。他所在的公司——伟大美国产品公司——上个月被一家AAA公司收购了，虽然只是一次较小的收购，但对这家小公司来说却是一次重大变革。

母公司已经安装了这种刻有脉轮，灌注业力的新型按摩椅。他们找来了十几个法师，在东亚的丛林里挥舞鸡骨头和野猪肠子。至少扫描条形码时是这么说的。

“这把椅子，”卡尔告诉我，“是一系列变革的第一步。像我们这样的小公司被收购后，所有者不会一下子改变所有东西。在过去他们经常这样做。而这让员工们适应起来非常困难，他们称之为‘企业文化冲击’。这家历史悠久的公司曾让心理医生来处理一位员工的问题，他完全失去了理智，在休息室里裸露身体并自杀了。”

[spoiler]

Karl is an example of a drone living “a life of quiet desperation,” but he should not be thought of as typical. While many drones are no doubt dissatisfied, a great many more enjoy the security blanket a corporation provides. Hours may be long, but the company offers benefits— travel and hotel vouchers or real vacations, daycare for children, recreation rooms, “play time,” and many other progressive innovations. This is not to say any given AAA wouldn’t cut their competitor’s throat given the chance, only that the corporations on top tend to have the most advanced means of keeping their employees content if not happy.

Albright is a wagemage fast-tracked to promotion on the corporate ladder. She’s two years younger than Karl and already looking at this department—sales and client retention—in the rearview. Karl’s last performance review wasn’t abysmal—he ranked in the lower middle in his department—but Albright takes a special dislike to him, or so he claims. Over the course of the day, I’ll come to know he’s right.

The hymn ends, everyone trailing off to their given cubic meter of corporate real estate. Karl tries to scatter with the crowd, and I’m reminded of animal documentaries where the herd runs, and the lion only gets one of them. Karl is that unfortunate wildebeest today.

“Late again, Karl.” Not a question.

“The buses were shut down due to a strike,” his voice weak, his heart not in it.

“Everyone knew the strike was coming. You should have left early. I messaged your AI, what’s his name, Albert, because I knew you’d forget.”

“Sorry?”

“I’ll throw a hex on your ass, Denisovich, so your privates shrivel and shrink.”

“My ex beat you to it.”

Her eyes narrow. She’ll have her reckoning with Karl, but not today.

Karl takes another of his deep sighs—I’m getting used to them—and sits down in his Singaporean self-articulating chair. The company he works for—Great American Products—was bought last month by one of the triple-As, a minor acquisition, but a major change for the smaller corp.

The parent company already installed these new, massaging, chakra charmed, karma-infused chairs. They get mages by the dozen to wave chicken bones and boar intestines over them somewhere in the jungles of East Asia. At least that’s what it says when you scan the bar code.

“This chair,” Karl tells me, “is the first step in a host of changes. A smaller corp like mine gets bought, the owners don’t change everything at once. They used to, back in olden times. Got so bad for employees trying to adjust they called it ‘corporate culture shock.’ This ancient company had therapists come in to deal with an employee that totally lost it, exposed himself and committed suicide in the break room.”

[size=14pt][b]错配员工[/b][/size]

公司不仅会根据员工个人的需求，也会根据算法和法师的预测，为他们量身定制最合适的岗位。但有一小部分人，比如卡尔，会从缝隙中溜走，就像上层管理者所说的“错配”。

> 我们就是这样认识卡尔的——他是个“错配者”。其中一位招聘人员保存了一篇她认为是秘密的博客，我们找到了它。我用了一些混沌数学，筛选出了六个左右的候选人。

> Louis 3.14

错配员工可能会不开心，或者至少更有可能是不开心的。因此，如果你在调查一个部门，寻找一个可转化为资产的薄弱环节，那么不妨看看你是否能找到标有“错配者”这个人性化昵称的档案，或者你正在调查的公司使用的类似标签。

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]MISFILED EMPLOYEES[/b][/size]

A corp fits a person not only to what they want, but to what their algorithms and mages predict is the best position for them. A small number, like Karl, slip through the cracks and get, as upper management calls it “misfiled.”

> That’s how we first got on to Karl—he was a “misfile.” One of the recruiters keeps a blog she thinks is secret, and we sussed it out. I used some chaos math and filtered down to six or so candidates.

> Louis 3.14

Misfiles are likely to be unhappy, or at least more likely, so if you’re scoping a department for a weak link to turn into an asset, see if you can find files tagged with that humanizing little moniker “misfile,” or whatever similar label the corp your’re
investigating uses.

卡尔知道很多事情，即使我不是企业文化专家，也能看出他的才能可能被浪费了在销售与客户维系部门。然而，他应该在入职时就已经被筛选过了。他为什么会来到这里呢？

当被问及他在公司的目标时，卡尔说：“我曾经有雄心壮志，但最近我在想，这有什么意义呢？我想要奥尔布赖特的工作吗？我是说，那是怎么回事？对着人大喊大叫？我不想那样。”

卡尔是大学毕业后从戏剧专业深造中应聘来的，这不是典型的企业职业生涯轨迹。然而，2060年代的许多公司开始转向人文学科，试图改变陈旧的企业团队。人性化公司成为新的流行趋势，而卡尔是成千上万被这种新举措吸引的人之一。

这份背景为他赢得了一个实习机会，并最终在销售部门找到了一份工作。曾几何时，他的前途一片光明——他善于与人打交道，深受同事喜爱，并且超额完成了他的销售指标。在过去的几个月里，他的绩效评估开始下滑，直到卡尔的“员工图表”看起来就像强化奥运会的跳台滑雪一样——陡然向下倾斜。

他突然意识到自己可能说得太多了，但我向他保证，他所说的一切都会得到公司的批准。他不会受到惩罚。

“他们有其他办法制裁你。”又是一声惯用的叹息。“我需要一杯豆咖。”

我不知道他是否还记得那个小瓶妖今早全程收看了他的豆咖灾难。

[spoiler]

Karl knows many things, and even I, no expert in corporate culture, can see his talents are likely being wasted in Sales and Client Retention. Yet he would have been screened upon hiring. Why did he end up here?

When asked about his goals with the company, Karl says, “I used to have ambitions, but lately I think, what’s the point? Do I want Albright’s job? I mean, what’s that about? Yelling at people? I don’t want that.”

Karl was recruited out of college and from depths of a drama program—not your typical corporate trajectory. Yet many companies in the 2060s began turning to the humanities in an attempt to shake up stale corporate bands. Humanizing the corporation became the new fad, and Karl was one of thousands scooped up in this new initiative.

That background landed him an internship and, eventually, a job in sales. Once upon a time, his path looked clear—he was good with people, liked by coworkers, and exceeded his quotas. Over the last months, his performance reviews began to slip until Karl’s “employee graph” looked like the run up to a ski jump at the Enhanced Olympics—steeply angled downward.

He catches himself then, realizing he’s perhaps said too much, but I reassure him that everything he says is cleared by the company. He cannot be punished.

“They have other ways of getting you.” Another patented sigh. “I need a soykaf.”

I wonder if he remembers the bottle imp was watching his soykaf debacle this morning.

[size=14pt][b]图表化进步[/b][/size]

员工图表是可视化任何给定员工数据的内部方法。图表的大方向(向上或向下)以及倾斜或下降的程度，可以让管理者快速了解员工的过去表现和预期表现。

正处于上升期的员工不太可能屈服于暗影狂奔者的贿赂或威胁。然而，正在走下坡路的人则可以成为首要目标。卡尔·杰尼索维奇的档案将他标记为被淘汰者，但他仍然拥有公司权限。这一点值得利用。

作为一种冗余措施，许多公司开始限制那些图表不理想的员工的访问权限。因此，在狂奔者可以最佳化利用那些看似即将跌入谷底的员工之间存在一个小窗口时间。

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]CHARTING PROGRESS[/b][/size]

Employee graphs are an internal way of visualizing data on any given worker. The general direction of the graph, up or down, coupled with the degree of inclination or declination, gives managers a quick précis of an employee’s past performance and projected performance.

Someone on their way up is less likely to succumb to the bribes or threats of a shadowrunner. Someone on their way down, however, can make a prime target. Karl Denisovich’s file marked him as a dead-ender, but he still has corporate access. That is worth exploiting.

As a redundancy, many corporations began to restrict access for employees with less-than-optimal looking graphs. There is therefore a small window of time during which runners can best exploit an employee seemingly on their way to the bottom.

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]休息室[/b][/size][/color]

窗明几净。有如医院般的整洁，甚至会让人产生闻到了消毒水味道的错觉，但实际上能闻到的是从通风口送入的森林松木的清凉气味。这种气味很微弱，但只要集中注意力就能嗅到。这里就是休息室，有着相对宽敞的空间，墙壁上挂着与气味相同的松树林图片。隐约能听到小鸟啁啾的鸣叫声。

冰箱看起来就像是在郊区家庭中会看到的那样，但我知道贴在其表面的磁吸装饰品几乎没有真的。伟大美国产品公司与一家名为“FLARE”的瑞士设计公司签订了合同，让这些冰箱看起来就像家一样温馨。冰箱上有一幅画，似乎是小孩子画的——一个用黄色蜡笔画的太阳和火柴人外型的一家人。一张得到A评级的纸张略微歪斜着。在这些假装家庭的小饰品中，夹杂着一些官方的公司印刷品。他们使用这种过时的印刷品形式，也是因为这样更“人性化”。当然，冰箱可以按照主人的意愿展示出任意外观，但在这个案例中，其所有者希望唤起人们对上个世纪的回忆。

一个身材矮小的美籍亚裔精灵正靠在早餐室的角落里喝着可乐。当卡尔进来时，她紧张地有些坐立不安，就像女孩们在喜欢一个男孩时那样。

她是艾丽克丝·金(Alex Kim)，是华盛顿大学的应届毕业生，与卡尔一样，也是从人文学科——金的情况是社会学——应聘进来的。她负责汇编客户数据，并应用各种过滤程序，以最佳方式分类“激发购买欲望”的“热点触发器”。

“嗨，艾丽克丝，”卡尔说，我立刻意识到他并不知道这个女孩对他的吸引力。卡尔就像一枚导弹一样径直向咖啡机走去，但它却坏了。

“是多蒂(Dotty)，” Alex说。

“他们把它禁用了？”

“我告诉过你，他们不会让她像那样说公司的坏话，而我们都参与了。”

“我没有。”你甚至能听出一丝哀鸣。

“他们把这称为连带损害，卡尔。”她笑了笑，然后迅速把笑容藏到了汽水罐后面。

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]THE BREAK ROOM[/b][/size][/color]

Clean. Hospital clean, almost antiseptic smelling were it not for the cool forest pine odor pumped in via the vents. It’s subtle, but you can detect it if you focus. This is the break room, a relatively spacious area whose walls display the images of that selfsame pine forest mimicked in the air. Birds chirp faintly.

The fridge looks like what you’d see in a suburban home, but I know few of the decorations magnetized to its face are authentic. Great American Products contracts a Swiss design firm called FLARE to make these fridges look homey. There’s a picture seemingly drawn by a young child—a yellow crayon-squash of a sun and stick-figure family. A paper with an A grade is just slightly skewed. Among these faux-familial bits are official corporate printouts. They use the antiquated print form because, again, it’s more “humanizing.” The fridge can, of course, display whatever the owner wishes but, in this case, the owner wants to evoke the previous century.

A short, Asian-American elf is leaning on the corner of the breakfast nook, sipping a cola. She fidgets nervously when Karl enters, the way girls do when they like a fellow.

She is Alex Kim, a recent graduate of the U of W and, like Karl, recruited out of a humanities program—in Kim’s case, sociology. She compiles client data and applies various filter programs to best sort the “hot button” triggers” that make them buy.

“Hoi, Alex,” Karl says, and I instantly realize he is unaware of the girl’s attraction to him. Like a homing missile, Karl makes for the soykaf machine. It doesn’t work.

“Dotty,” Alex says.

“They took it away?”

“I told you they wouldn’t let her talk that way about the company, and we all joined in.”

“I didn’t.” You can almost hear the whine.

“They call that collateral damage, Karl.” She smiles, then quickly hides it away behind her soda-can.

[size=14pt][b]全视之眼[/b][/size]

当你加入一家公司时，你就默认接受了不间断的监视。大部分监控是如此隐秘，以至于根本没人能注意到，但他们都知道它的存在。事实上，如果没有这种监视，他们甚至会感觉到失落。

现代办公室到处都是各种微型摄像头，这也包括了员工的通讯链，主管和安保人员通常都可以访问。绝大多数摄像头都具有摄像和录音功能。从表面上看，这些措施是为了防止企业间谍活动。实际上，它们监听的是员工间的偶然对话。

任何对公司发表负面言论的人都会被记录下来。这些都会以密文代码的形式被归档到他们的员工档案中，并且会影响员工图表。虽然这种监视严格来说并不合法，但却很常见。

公司很少对这些员工采取直接行动，但会通过多种方式表达不悦。通常情况下，他们会通过例如强制加班、禁止访问某些矩阵区块，以及像卡尔遇到的拆除自动售货机或使饮料机失效等一系列方式来惩罚整个部门。

> 看看这个，伙计。我和我的团队曾在当地校园里发现了一个新无政府主义团体，他们特意混进公司的招聘活动，只是为了用直到第二天才会显现的纳米涂料破坏公司内部。总之，我们给其中一个人塞了些新元，让他把自动售货机弄坏了，这样我们就可以用“第六纪可乐官方维修技术人员”的身份进去修理了。

  我们在自动售货机里安装了侦察装置，结果收获颇丰。长话短说——我知道太晚了——员工们认为公司是在惩罚他们，结果第二天上班时乱成一团。哈哈。工蜂们需要好好整顿一下了

[size=14pt][b]ALL-SEEING EYES[/b][/size]

When you sign on with a corporation, you sign on for constant surveillance. Most of this is so passive that a drone never notices it, but they know it is there. In fact, if it weren’t, they might even miss it.

A variety of tiny cameras are all over the modern office— including in the employee commlinks, which supervisors and security typically can access. The vast majority of the available cameras have both video and audio recording capabilities. Ostensibly, these measures exist to prevent corporate espionage. In practice, they listen in on the incidental conversation between employees.

Anyone speaking poorly of the corporation is logged and noted. In a secret code, this is filed in their employee dossier and even affects the Employee Graph. While not strictly “legal,” this surveillance is nonetheless common.

Corporations rarely take direct action against such employees, though their displeasure is made known in a variety of ways. Often, they punish the entire department by creating mandatory extra hours, killing access to certain areas of the Matrix and, as in Karl’s case, removing vending machines or rendering beverage machines inert.

> Check this out, omae. My team and I once cottoned on to a neo-anarchist group on local campuses who purposefully got in on corporate recruiting tours, only to vandalize the insides of said corps with nano-paint that wouldn’t appear until the next day. Anyway, we slipped one of them some nuyen to break the vending machine, so we could conveniently come in and fix it as “official Sixth World Cola repair-techs.”

  We set up our recon inside the machine, and boy did it pay off. Long story short—too late, I know—the employees thought the corporation was punishing them and had a fit at work the next day. Heh. The drones needed a good shakeup.

卡尔看起来明显有些动摇，甚至有些泄气，就好像通向豆咖的最新障碍把他脚下的存在主义脚手架给推倒了。“多蒂，”他念叨着。

一个看上去寿命将尽的大个子兽人走了进来。他的灰白长发不符合公司要求。从外表上看，他是个新嬉皮士。你可以想象到他的样子，他的头发既长又染成了多种色彩，挥舞着旗帜反对当时的UCAS军事行动。

“乔治，”卡尔点了点头。

“是多蒂，”他说，怒视着豆咖机。“她太多嘴了。让我们都很难堪。”

艾丽克丝耸了耸肩。“我们也无能为力。真让人讨厌(Frag)。”说脏话不适合这位年轻的精灵。她说得就好像这个词里充满了最苦涩的柠檬味。

乔治笑了。"确实讨厌。你知道这个词是怎么来的吗？"

"当然，"艾丽克丝说，"以前的电子游戏。大家都知道。"

乔治摇了摇头。卡尔低声对我说，“现在我们要听历史课了”，但他听起来并不介意。

“大约一百年前，当时这里还是一个国家，他们和东南亚的另一个地方发生了战争。那些被派去的军队，呃，很多时候可以说是‘管理不善’。所以，如果遇到了一个让士兵送命的军官，他们就会在他的营房里安装一颗手榴弹。他们将手榴弹设置为陷阱，装在门上。当那个坏军官进来时，嘣！然后就再也没有军官了。”

乔治环顾房间，仿佛是在确保无处不在的摄像头都捕捉到了这一幕。他身材魁梧，即使在他这个年纪也很强壮。很明显，这是一种没人会认错的威胁。第二天，我被告知，豆咖机又开始正常工作了。

> 如果有人认为机器的修复与乔治的发言有关，那他们就太夸大工蜂的影响力了。

卡尔看了看通讯链。还有两个小时才到午饭时间。

"我只是想喝杯豆咖，该死"。他这么说着就走了出去。

"每个人都有自己的渴求，"乔治说。我看到艾丽克丝看着卡尔离开，她的脸颊因为我的目光而微微泛红。

Karl looks visibly shaken, deflated almost, as if this latest barrier to coffee knocks the existential scaffolding from under his feet. “Dotty,” he says.

A large ork pushing his expiration date comes in. His long gray hair isn’t corporate approved. He looks, by all appearances, to have been a neo-hippie. You can imagine him, his hair just as long but full of color, waving flags against the UCAS military actions of his day.

“George,” Karl says and nods.

“Dotty,” he says, looking with ire at the soykaf machine. “She talks too much. Makes us all look bad.”

Alex shrugs. “Nothing we can do about it. Frag it.” Swearing doesn’t become the young elf. She says it like the word is laced with the bitterest of lemon.

George smiles. “Frag her indeed. You know where that term comes from?”

“Sure,” Alex says, “old video games. Everyone knows that.”

George shakes his head. Karl leans over and whispers to me, “We’re going to get a history lesson now,” but he doesn’t sound like he minds.

“About a hundred years ago, back when all this was a single country, they had a war with another place over in Southeast Asia. The troops they sent, well, they were what we’d call ‘under poor management’ much of the time. So, you get yourself an officer that’s getting the men killed, and they’d set a fragmentation grenade up in his sleeping quarters. They set it up trapped to the door. Your bad management type, he comes in and boom! No more officer.”

George looks around the room as if to make sure the omnipresent cameras are catching this. He’s big, and strong even at his age, and there is little mistaking this as anything but a threat. The next day, I’m told, the soykaf machine is back on.

> If anyone thought the restoration of the machine had anything to do with George’s talk, they have an overinflated notion of how much influence drones have.

> Cosmo

Karl looks at his phone. Lunch is still two hours away.

“I just wanted a soykaf, damn it.” He says and marches out.

“Everybody just wants something,” George says. I see Alex watch Karl as he goes, her cheeks flushing as her eyes catch mine.

在这场运动偃旗息鼓之后，乔治和其他许多人一样，找了一份力所能及的工作。有些人出卖了自己，转而加入了公司。

这些退伍军人拥有战术技能，而那些新嬉皮士天生就反对公司。当他们被雇佣时，筛选方法远没有现在这么先进，许多人都随着时间推移被淘汰了。

给聪明的狂奔者们一个建议：如果你能对这些人进行适当的甄别，你会拥有一笔非常有用的资产，甚至能让他们掩人耳目地做到一些事情。

> 这一点毫不夸张。你必须仔细筛选数据或者通过你的人脉来找到合适的退伍军人/新嬉皮士，但想找到一个就像找到一个非公司伪造的密码网站一样困难。

  然而，这些人大多都比较年长，要和他们玩花招是很困难的。我不在乎你自认为有多么狡猾，狂奔者，一个人到了七十多岁，他必然已经学到了一两件狗屎的事。坦率面对这些人通常是更好的方法。

[size=14pt][b]MORE ABOUT GEORGE[/b][/size]

It turns out George—full name George Kezmaki-Kline— fought in some of the UCAS wars he later protested. When he came back from those wars, he joined the neo-hippie movement. Said movement, for those of you too lazy to search, preached peace through the shared reality of the Matrix. Early proponents of the Matrix were idealistic enough to believe that the shared network would remain free. Tell that to your omaes, loyal readers.

After the movement fizzled, George, along with many others, took jobs where they could. Some sold out and went corporate.

These vets have tactical skills, and those who were neohippies are anti-corporate by nature. When they were hired, screening methods were not nearly so advanced, and many were simply grandfathered in as time passed.

A word to smart runners: If you scope these men and women properly, you could have a very handy asset that might even be able to cover their tracks.

> That ain’t no lie. You have to sift through the data or work your contacts to find the right vet/neo-hippie, but finding one is like finding a password site that isn’t a corporate fake.

  These fellows are mostly older, though, and it’s hard to put one over on them. I don’t care how slick you think you are, chummer, a man gets to be upwards of seventy, he’s learned a thing or two about bulldrek. Being upfront with theses types is usually the better method.

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]电话会议[/b][/size][/color]

房间是一个长长的椭圆形，中间是一张真正的红木桌子，该公司向我保证，这张桌子是根据原作克隆出来的。整个房间看起来就像一艘帆船的厨房，就是你在英国海军模拟游戏中看到的那种。部门里的大部分人都聚集在这里，每个人都戴着轻便、几乎看不见的远程呈现眼镜。

今天，会议在伦敦的特拉法加广场举行。你可以听到海鸥的叫声，它们柔软的白色背影就像广场上铺开的一片雪地。那里有一座雕像，是那位海军上将——纳尔逊的雕像，眼镜上的说明是这么告诉我的——我认为这位CEO对十九世纪的海军情有独钟。

天空灰蒙蒙的，有时在普吉特海湾上空能看到的那种低沉忧郁的颜色。我从未真正去过伦敦，但它的第一印象很像西雅图，如果再过一千年的话。无论如何，天气似乎是一样的。我几乎可以嗅到空气中的雨味，虽然这些设备实际上没有气味模块。

一个穿着黑色西装的人大步走过广场，海鸥像被编排好一样突然成群结队地飞起。它们在上空盘旋着。这个人坚持让奥尔布赖特叫他艾迪，他是一个精灵，皮肤的颜色像浅色的拿铁咖啡。他特意与每个人握手，而会议室里的每个职员都佩戴了触觉反馈装置。

他甚至在我面前停下了脚步，用他的眼睛仔细观察我。“我知道你是我们今天的记者。我们的——”说到这里，他停顿了一下，显然是在看他终端上的显示“——卡尔就在这里。我再怎么强调都不为过，我们是多么依赖一线的人们。他们才是伟大美国产品公司的真正支柱。”他那优雅的口音和微妙的魅力几乎让我相信了他的话。

一小时后，会议变得有些拖沓。从会议室内其他浮动的目光来看，我并不是唯一一个感到无聊的人。然而，卡尔的眼睛却专注地盯着艾迪·辛格(Eddy Singh)先生。他看起来真的很投入，我认为他正在利用《普吉特海湾》提供的聚光灯，试图重启自己的职业生涯。直到当他皱了皱眉，露出微表情时，我才低头看向他的触觉设备，意识到他正在玩游戏。我不知道他是如何在没有被察觉的情况下切入游戏的。他对企业安保的了解比我想象的要深。

艾迪·辛格喋喋不休地谈论客户关系和提供其他竞争对手所不具备的“无形品质”。他用了很多次这个词，“无形”。我的视线又回到了天空和那些在灰色天空中盘旋的海鸥。其中一只海鸥在特拉法加广场上空以更紧密的方式移动，就像一只正在游弋的掠食者。它发现我在看它，突然又回到了海鸥群中。这是怎么回事？忠实的读者们，我将稍后再详述。

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]THE CONFERENCE CALL[/b][/size][/color]

The room is a long ellipsoid centered on what the company assured me is a real redwood table cloned from the originals. The whole room looks like it belongs in the galley of one of those sailing galleons, the sort you see in British Naval sims. Most of the department is gathered here, each wearing lightweight, nearly invisible telepresence glasses.

Today, the meeting is taking place in Trafalgar Square, London. You can hear the gulls, soft white backs like a carpet of snow across the square. There’s that statue there, the one of that admiral—Nelson, the glasses inform me with a caption—and I decide the CEO has a fetish for nineteenth-century naval kitsch.

The sky is gray, that downcast melancholy color you get over the Sound sometimes. I’ve never been to London physically, but the first impression is it looks a lot like Seattle if Seattle were a thousand years older. The weather, anyway, seems the same. I can almost smell the rain in the air, but these rigs do not actually have scent modules.

A man in a black suit strides across the square, and the gulls, as if choreographed, take off in a great shoal. They whirl above. The man, who insists Albright call him Eddy, is an elf with skin the color of a light latte. He makes a point of shaking everyone’s hand, the conference room crew having worn haptics.

He even stops at me, his eyes studying me carefully. “And I understand you’re our journalist for the day. A day in the life of our”— and here he pauses, obviously reading a display on his end—“Karl here. Well, I cannot stress enough how we depend on the women and men in the trenches. They’re the real backbone of Great American Products.” His posh accent and subtle charm almost make me believe him.

An hour later, the meeting is dragging. Judging by some of the other floating eyes in the room, I am not the only one bored. Karl, however, has his eyes locked intently on Mr. Eddy Singh. He really seems absorbed, and I think he’s using the spotlight Puget Sounds! provides to attempt to reboot his career. It’s only when he winces, a micro-expression really, that I look down at his hand in the haptics and realize he’s playing a game. I don’t know how he managed to insert it without detection. He knows his way around the corporate AIs better than I thought.

Eddy Singh drones on about client relationships and providing that “intangible quality” other competitors do not. He uses that word a lot, intangible. My own eyes have drifted back to the sky and the whirling flock of gulls pockmarking the gray sky. One moves in a tighter pattern, a roving predator above Trafalgar Square. It sees me seeing it and abruptly rejoins the fold. What was that about? More on that later, loyal reader.

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]午餐[/b][/size][/color]

我还在新闻学院读书时，一位教授告诉我们，每个故事都是约瑟夫·坎伯著作《千面英雄》的变体。如果这是真的，那么这个故事就是为了追寻一杯优质的豆咖。

从早上与阿拉斯泰尔的争吵，到2075年的休息室大失望事件，再到你即将阅读到的午餐事件，卡尔今天的目标只是为了喝到一杯好豆咖。正如您将要看到的，忠实的读者，最终这将引导他到一个非常奇怪的地方。现在，让我们回到午餐时间。

一个小时，这就是一名工蜂能享受到的午餐时间。如果他们足够幸运的话。尽管人力资源部门对这一个小时的严格程度因公司而异，但大多数公司都不赞成午餐时间过长。那种事情是为高管准备的，而不是工蜂。你不太可能看到一名工蜂吃着“三杯马提尼的午餐”，但那些身价百万的高管们却可以逍遥自在。

[color=green]译注：三杯马提尼的午餐(three-martini lunch)代指有钱有闲的上层阶级可以享有的悠闲、放纵的午餐时光，[/color]

我们必须理解高管和工蜂之间的阶级鸿沟。与社会上其他阶层或种姓一样，当一个阶层与另一个阶层打交道时，存在一些不成文的潜规则。虽然您，我们忠实的读者，不太可能会遇到一个高管——社会的重重障碍和不在少数的保镖确保了这一点——但一名工蜂却有可能。许多人都希望有朝一日能成为高管，而企业文化也鼓励这种梦想。

然而，对于绝大多数工蜂来说，中层管理职位已经是金字塔的顶端了。卡尔曾经渴望更多。如今，我觉得他甚至都不再渴望管理职位。他的身体还在椅子上，但他的灵魂已经飘出了门。

这又把我们带回了午餐时间，这是工蜂在12个小时的工作日中唯一的私人时间。如果你不是工蜂，那你就需要意识到，卡尔一半以上的时间，无论他是否清醒，都在为公司工作。当你仔细分析数据时会发现，他生命中超过一半的时间都奉献给了公司。

午餐时间是一个短暂的间歇。今天，卡尔放弃了公司的自助餐厅，转而去寻找一杯像样的豆咖。

> 公司食堂很像二十世纪的公司商店。那时候，人才是真正的矿工，而非无人机。他们的工资最终都流入了这些公司商店。他们付给你工资，然后你又把钱交给他们。你永远走不出这个怪圈。真是残酷。

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]LUNCH[/b][/size][/color]

When I was in journalism school, a professor told the class that every story is a variation of Joseph Campbell’s Hero’s Journey. If that’s true, this story is the quest for a cup of quality soykaf.

From his morning argument with Alastair to the Great Break Room Disappointment of 2075, to the lunch incident you’re about to read, Karl’s objective for the day was simply to get a good cup of soykaf. Ultimately—as you’ll see, loyal reader—it leads him to a very strange place indeed. For now, back to lunch.

One hour, that’s all a drone gets for lunch. If they are lucky. While the strictness with which human resources tracks this hour varies from corporation to corporation, most frown upon taking a long lunch. That sort of thing is for executives, not drones. You are not likely to see a drone have a three-martini liquid lunch, but some gold-plated execs can get away with it.

One must understand the divide between the executive and drone class. As is the case with any other stratification or caste in society, there are unspoken rules when one tier deals with the other. While you, loyal reader, are not likely to ever meet an executive—a host of social barriers, and not a few bodyguards, ensure this—a drone very well may. Many hope to become executives one day, and corporate culture encourages this dream.

Yet for the vast majority of drones, a middle-man-agement position is the top of the pyramid. Karl once aimed for more. Today, I don’t think he even aims for management. His body is in the chair, but his soul is already out the door.

Which brings us back to lunch, the drone’s only personal space in a twelve-hour day. If you aren’t a drone, you need to realize that half of Karl’s hours, waking or otherwise, are spent working for his corporation. When you break down the stats, more than half his life is devoted to the company.

Lunch is a brief redoubt. Today, Karl eschews the company cafeteria in search of a decent cup of soykaf. 

> And the company cafeteria is a lot like twentieth century company stores. Back then, you had actual people going into mines instead of drones. Their wages wound up getting put right back into the company at these stores. They pay you, then you pay them. You never get ahead. Vicious.

> Dr. Spin
[/spoiler]

我问他，为什么不在自助餐厅买杯豆咖？

“也可以，但楼下的咖啡太糟糕了，”当我们站在十字路口等待时，他这样说。一个欢快的数字小人出现了，跳起了他的步行舞。我们穿过马路。你可以闻到来自海洋的咸味，在这个中午被强风吹到了城市深处。

“我在海边长大，”卡尔自发地说道。“在一个小岛上。我父亲是个艺术家。在他那个圈子里很成功。母亲……总之，我是闻着这样的空气长大的。”卡尔的母亲有一天走进太平洋淹死了。调查表明是自杀，但卡尔的父亲与那些有影响力的人有着足够密切的关系，使得官方的死因被裁定为“意外死亡”。当我进一步询问他的母亲时，卡尔沉默了。

“最好的咖啡。这边走，我知道一个小地方。”

他所说的“小地方”位于皮阿拉普区内的一个流浪者营地内。尽管在2050年代初期，一些公司对该地区进行了投资，但令人奇怪的是，流浪者营地仍未被私有化。在雷尼尔山投射出的菱形阴影下，能看到一个由瓦楞铁皮屋顶堆积而成的棚户营地。

卡尔自信地在营地中穿行，同时承认却又无视那些无SIN者。他拉着我的手，引导我穿过熙熙攘攘的人群。他们戴着兜帽，偷偷地朝我们的方向张望——很显然，我们在这里有些格格不入，但这些游民们却和工蜂做了笔好生意。

我们在一个咖啡摊前排了一小段队，这个咖啡摊是由一辆旧灰狗巴士的部分残骸改造而成的。

“这就是城里最好的豆咖，” 卡尔说道。“这其实是一家独立企业。你在其他地方看到的所谓‘独立’企业，不过都是企业的幌子。如果你想要真正的、地道的咖啡，来这里就对了。”

当然，只有当你有足够的时间在工作时间前往皮阿拉普的流浪者营地时，你才会来这里，但卡尔似乎愿意付出必要的时间。

制作豆咖的黄铜机器看起来就像是蒸汽朋克电影里的东西。这台机器不停发出老式火车般的轰鸣和震动，而后近乎黑色的焦油状液体厚重而粘稠地旋转着流出。纸杯是这里的首选。我看到一些纸杯被丢弃在摊位前，已经开始自我降解了。

卡尔抿了一口他的热咖啡，露出了微笑，但并不是对我笑。

"你在这里开心吗？" 我问道。

"怎么说？"

"我今天一整天都没见你笑过，除了在会议室的那一刻。你当时并不是在看辛格。”

他又笑了，“我当时在优化我的《觉醒：1949》角色。”他的笑容转为了一丝不悦，问我为什么提到他在这里开心。

"只是观察而已。" 我告诉他。毕竟，记者不应该影响他们的采访对象。

[spoiler]

I ask him, can’t he just get soykaf in the cafeteria?

“Yes, but it’s terrible downstairs,” he says as we wait at a crosswalk. The jaunty little digital man appears and does his walking dance. We cross. You can smell the salt air from the ocean, blown deep into the city by stiff winds this noon.

“I grew up on the ocean,” Karl says unprompted. “Little island. My father was an artist. Successful with a certain set. Mom was … well, anyway, I grew up smelling air like this. Karl’s mother walked into the Pacific one day and drowned. Research indicates suicide, but Karl’s father had enough connections with influential people that the official cause was ruled as “accidental.” When I asked about his mother further, Karl shut down.

“Kaf. The best. This way, little place I know.”

The “little place” he knows is located inside one of Puyallup’s squatter camps. While corporations invested in the neighborhood in the early 2050s, the squatter camps remain curiously unprivatized. A shantytown of corrugated iron roofs heaps against the black rhomboid of Mt. Rainier in the background.

Karl moves with confidence through the camp, simultaneously acknowledging yet ignoring the SINless. He takes me by the hand and steers me through the wanting crowd. Hooded eyes, furtive glances in our direction—it’s clear we don’t belong, and yet the squatters do a good business with the drone set.

We wind up in a short queue at a rattle-trap kaf stall carved out of the partial carcass of an old Greyhound bus.

“Best soykaf in the city,” Karl says. “This is actually an indie biz. Those so-called ‘indies’ you see elsewhere, they’re corporate fronts. You want real, salt-of-the-earth kaf, you come here.”

You only come here, of course, if you have enough time to travel to a Puyallup squatter camp during work hours, but Karl seems willing to make the needed time commitment.

The brass machine that makes the soykaf looks like something out of a steampunk trideo. It chugs and vibrates with all the gusto of an old train, as the near-black tar comes out in heavy, viscous loops. Paper cups are the choice here. I see some littered around the front of the stall that are already self-degrading.

Karl sips his hot kaf and smiles, though not at me.

“You’re happy here?” I ask.

“How do you mean?”

“I haven’t seen you smile all day, except for a moment in the conference room. You weren’t watching Singh.”

He smiles again, “Optimizing my Awakening: 1949 character.” His smile turns to a scowl, and he asks why I mentioned his being happy here.

“Just an observation,” I tell him. A reporter should not influence the subject of their profile, after all.

[size=14pt][b]工蜂的流浪生活[/b][/size]

工蜂和流浪者似乎是一个不太可能的组合，但工蜂频繁造访营地是有其合理原因的——独立企业。众所周知，独立企业主要存在于各种企业的保护伞之下。企业之所以不将它们改头换面，正是因为人们光顾这些小店、餐车和摊贩的原因就是它们并非公开与某个公司挂钩。

虽然每个人都知道它们中的大多数实际上是企业所有的，但谁也不能确定哪些不是。这就为那些原本属于大型连锁企业的地方增添了某种魅力。

企业的工蜂们经常会寻找一些安全但前卫的东西，而流浪者社区满足了这种需求。工蜂并不真正属于这里，而暴力的威胁至少在表面上存在。这就是工蜂风格的“流浪生活”。

事实上，这些营地由多个安保机构监管，可以说是相对安全的。那些真正危险的地方，比如战区和非军事区，是不会提供豆咖的，他们也都不会在公开场合进行交易。

流浪者营地提供了一个与工蜂会面的良好中立地点。这里几乎没有公司存在，而孤星、游侠骑士及其竞争对手都已经习惯于看到工蜂与营地中那些非传统时尚受害者打成一片。狂奔者可以很好地融入其中。

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]SLUMMING DRONES[/b][/size]

Drones and squatters seem like an unlikely mix, but there is a logical reason for drones to frequent the camps— independent businesses. It’s an open secret that independent businesses exist largely under various corporate umbrellas. The corporations do not rebrand them precisely because people patronize these little shops, food vans and carts because they are not openly tied to a corporation.

While everyone knows most of them are really corporate owned, one can never be sure which are not. This lends a certain charm to places that would otherwise be part of a large chain.

Corp drones often look for something safely edgy, and the squatter communities serve this need. Drones don’t really belong here, and the threat of violence hangs in the air, at least ostensibly. This is “slumming it,” drone style.

In truth, the camps are policed by various security agencies and are relatively safe. The really dangerous places, like combat zones and DMZs, don’t offer soykaf, and none of their business is done in the open.

Squatter camps provide a good, neutral location to meet a drone. Corporate presence is near non-existent and Lone Star, Knight Errant and their competition are used to seeing drones mingle with the non-traditional fashion victims seen in the camps. Runners fit right in.

“见鬼，我没时间吃一顿真正的午餐。” 卡尔啜饮着摊贩自制的豆咖，步履匆匆地赶回办公室。他指了指街对面的一家暴食屋，我们走了进去。

在这里，回到了舒适且熟悉的无情品牌环境中，卡尔在营地中的微笑已经远在几公里之外了。他走入便携午餐货架，拿起了一个“活力午餐包”，准备回到办公室加热。我没有跟过去。在门口停住了脚步。

这是因为这家暴食屋正在被抢劫。

两个男人戴着二十年前的全息电影明星才会戴的那种乳胶面具。其中的巨魔手里紧握着一把雷明顿·室内清扫者，指着我的方向。我甚至可以顺着枪管爬下去。它就那么大。

“进来。” 他转向卡尔，卡尔现在才意识到了情况。“你，打领带的，站到那个女士旁边，让我能看到你。”

卡尔慢慢地走向我，双手举在空中，右手仍然拿着他的活力午餐包。他没有像今早在列车上那样颤抖，相反，他表现出一种怪异的平静。他的脸就像全息影片中的英雄一样，我不知道卡尔的脑海中是否正在播放这样的场景。求你了，别做傻事，我这么想。该死的，两周前我还写了一篇文章，关于在办公室枪击事件中试图扮演狙击手斯莱德的公司工蜂。为了那篇报道，我去了很多次太平间。

这次他没有那么紧张。他脸上惯有的表情突然变得冷漠，就像一个反社会分子觉得你没有在看他时的表情。这是我今天中第一次不同情卡尔。我说不出自己的感受。也许是恐惧吧。

“你要逞英雄吗，工蜂？”那个巨魔看透了他的心思，这样问道。那个小个子的男人正在命令暴食屋的店员在他们洗劫电子消费品货架时坐着别动。

“还有这个，”小个子说着，一把将整个货架上的三津滨克隆神户牛肉干塞给店员，店员则把它们放到袋子里。

我现在明白了，卡尔不在这里。我不知道他在哪。也许是在某个游戏中。

[spoiler]

“Drek, I don’t have time for a real lunch.” Karl’s wired on the homemade soykaf, and his pace is double-timing it back to the office. He points toward a Stuffer Shack across the street, and we go inside.

Here, back in the comfortable familiarity of the relentlessly branded, Karl’s ghetto smile is several kilometers away. He picks the portable lunch aisle and scoops up a “POWR-Lunch” package to nuke back at the office. I don’t follow. I stop in my tracks at the door.

That’s because the Stuffer Shack is in the process of being robbed.

Two men wear the latex faces of trid stars from two decades ago. The troll holds a Remington Roomsweeper in a balled up fist and points it my way. I could crawl down the barrel. It’s that big.

“Inside.” He turns to Karl, who only now realizes the situation. “You, necktie, where I can see you by the lady.”

Karl walks slowly over to me, arms in the air, right hand still carrying his POWR-Lunch. He isn’t quivering like on the train this morning; instead, he projects an eerie calm. His face is like that of the hero in a trid, really, and I wonder if a scene like that plays through Karl’s mind. Please, don’t do anything stupid, I think. Hell, I wrote the article two weeks ago about the corp drone who tried to go Slade the Sniper during an office shooting. I made one of my many trips to the morgue for that story.

He isn’t tense this time. The usual look on his face has gone suddenly cold, like how a sociopath might look if they thought you weren’t watching. It’s the first time in the day I don’t feel sorry for Karl. I cannot say what I feel. Fear maybe.

“You going to play hero, drone?” the troll asks, reading him. The smaller man is ordering the Stuffer Shack clerk to sit still while they loot the consumer electronics aisle.

“And this too,” the smaller man says, shoving the entire display of Mitsuhama’s Kobe-Klone Beef Jerky at the clerk, who puts it in the bag.

Karl isn’t here; I see that now. I don’t know where he is. Maybe in a game.

[size=14pt][b]工蜂的犯罪白日梦[/b][/size]

与VITAS相关的是一种尚未命名的"综合症"，即市民试图干预危险情况。尽管游侠骑士与该市签订了合同，但像暴食屋这样的抢劫案并不罕见(尤其是因为位于中低收入社区的暴食屋并非游侠骑士的首要保护对象)。

全息影片与游戏美化了普通人在遇到这种情况时的反应，从而催生了被媒体称作“米堤事件”的情况。这是指一个普通人(通常与公司有关系)将全息影片与现实混淆，并试图扮演英雄的时刻。这些事件总是以悲剧收场。

心理学家将这些失败的干预归因于工蜂和类似人群在被严格限制的生活中积压的愤怒和挫败感。该理论认为，在刻板的循规蹈矩中度过的生活，容易使人产生一时的纯粹冲动。在媒体塑造的孤胆英雄神话的支撑下，在“战或逃”的肾上腺素的巨大作用下，个人会突然爆发，试图阻止暴力行为。

仅去年在西雅图就有12人因试图扮演英雄而丧生。

> 这是真的，但他们没有告诉你的是这也是一名工蜂会与像我这样的狂奔者合作的原因。他们中的一些人渴望着我们拥有的生活。他们梦想在暗影中狂奔，拿着一把H&K，开着跳线反射，使用个人战斗程序评估情况并选择目标向量。问题是，他们没有跳线反射，他们唯一一支开过火的H&K是在《狂奔吧，狂奔者》游戏中。

  这是一种妄想，但这是一种我们可以利用的妄想，你知道吗？给某人一个机会来实现这样的幻想，哪怕只是一点点，你也会惊讶地发现，他们陷入街头黑暗一面的速度如此之快。

  但绝对，绝对不要，将他们带到真正的任务中。

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]THE SECRET CRIMINAL LIFE OF DRONES[/b][/size]

Related to VITAS is an as-yet-unnamed “syndrome” in which citizens attempt to intervene in dangerous situations. Despite Knight Errant’s contract with the city, robberies like the one at the Stuffer Shack are not rare (especially because Stuffer Shacks in middle- and lower-class neighborhoods are not top KE priorities).

A life of trids and games glamorizing the common man’s reaction to situations like this gave birth to what the press named “Mitty Events.” These are moments when an average Joe, usually with corp ties, confuses trids for reality and tries to play the hero. These events invariably end tragically.

Psychologists have ascribed these failed interventions to the pent-up anger and frustration of the closely proscribed life of the drone and those like her. Lives spent in rigid conformity, the theory argues, lend themselves to moments of sheer impulsiveness. Backed by a media myth of the lone hero, and under terrible amounts of fight-or-flight adrenaline, the individual snaps and tries to stop the violent act.

Twelve people died in Seattle alone last year trying to play the hero. 

> It’s true, but what they don’t tell you is it’s also a reason a drone will work with a runner like me. Some of them want the lives we have. They have wet dreams about running the shadows with an H&K, wired reflexes, and personal combat programs assessing a situation and selecting target vectors. Thing is, they don’t have wired reflexes and the only H&K they ever shot was in Run, Run, Runner.

  That’s delusional, but it’s a delusion we can use, you know? Give someone a chance to live out a fantasy like this, even a little, and you’d be surprised how quick they fall in with the darker side of the street.

  Don’t ever, never, bring one on an actual run though.

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]不满的原因[/b][/size][/color]

如果我身边的卡尔即将失去理智，让我们花一分钟来探讨一下原因。毕竟，纵观整个人类历史，他的生活水平是绝大多数人所羡慕的。他拥有无穷无尽、令人惊叹的娱乐选择。他衣食无忧。那么，他为什么不快乐呢？为什么他会对自己的生活如此不满，以至于不惜牺牲自己的一切？很高兴你这么问。以下是一些常见的不满来源，以及操控者可以利用这些不满情绪的方法。狂奔者请注意：当竞争对手公司试图使另一家公司的员工叛变时，也会使用与这些相同的清单，这绝非偶然。当你在试图策反其他公司的员工时很可能会遇到来自另一家公司的企业间谍。而企业间谍活动无疑是错综复杂的。

[spoiler]
[color=brown][size=14pt][b]CAUSES OF DISCONTENT[/b][/size][/color]

If Karl, right next to me, is about to lose his head, let’s take a minute to explore why. After all, if we look at the whole of humanity throughout the history of the world, he has a standard of living that the majority of people who have lived would envy. He has entertainment options that are infinite and amazing. He is sheltered and fed. So why is he not happy? Why would he have so much discontent with his life that he might put everything he has at risk? Glad you asked. Here is a list of some common sources of discontent and ways operatives can use them to their advantage. Note to runners: It is no accident that rival corporations use the same list as these when getting a rival corp’s employees to defect. You may very well run up against a corporate agent while trying to turn someone in another company. Corporate espionage is nothing if not Byzantine.
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]停滞不前的事业[/b][/size]

工蜂的职业生涯往往是他们世界的生命力所在。虽然暗影狂奔者可能很难理解，但这些人生来就是为了在公司的阶梯上向上攀爬。当他们的晋升势头停滞不前时，他们就会变得焦躁不安。

在这种情况下，狂奔者最好的办法就是提供叛逃选择。如果叛逃者为竞争对手公司工作，他们或许可以通过谈判为工蜂在新公司谋得更好的职位。当然，任何接受叛逃者的公司都会在之后密切关注他们，但这不是你的问题，对吧，伙计？

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]STAGNANT CAREER[/b][/size]

A drone’s career is often the very elan vital of their world. While it might be hard for a shadowrunner to understand, these folk live to move up the corporate ladder. When their upward mobility stalls, they become restless.

In a case such as this, the best route for a runner is to offer defection. Assuming the runner works for a rival corporation, they might be able to negotiate a better position for the drone in the new corporation. Of course, any corporation accepting a defector keeps a close eye on them afterwards, but that isn’t your problem, is it, chummer?
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]金钱[/b][/size]

和其他人一样，工蜂也有金钱问题。他们借贷过多，过着入不敷出的生活，渴望享受高管们拥有的那种财富。机敏的狂奔者可以从街头巷尾的任何人身上嗅出贪婪的味道，工蜂也不例外。这是一种直接的贿赂行为，狂奔者提供金钱以换取信息或服务。这种手段可以是临时的，也可以是长期的。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]MONEY[/b][/size]

Drones have money issues like everyone else. They take out too much credit, they live beyond their means and they long for the kind of money their executives enjoy. A smart runner can smell greed on anyone streetside, and drones are no different. This is straight-up bribery, as the runner offers money in exchange for information or services. This can be a temporary or permanent arrangement.
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]成瘾[/b][/size]

工蜂是否比无SIN者更不容易成瘾，还是说他们只是隐藏得更好？BTL芯片、老式街头毒品、赌博、怪异的性癖——工蜂就像我们其他人一样有着自我毁灭的倾向。

利用这些嗜好往往很容易。工蜂可能是需要戒毒，或是欠了首尔派的债，亦或是与孤星有矛盾。如果狂奔者能让这些问题消失，他们就上钩了。嘿，操纵别人的疾病可能不道德，但话又说回来，你又不是要从事道德方面的职业，对吧？

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]ADDICTION[/b][/size]

Are drones less prone to addiction than the SINless, or do they just hide it better? BTL chips, old street drugs, gambling, bizarre sexual practices—drones have self-destructive proclivities the same as the rest of us.

Exploiting these is often easy. The drone might need a fix, be in debt to a Seoulpa Ring, or in trouble with Lone Star. If the runner can make these problems go away, they have the fish on the hook. Hey, it might not be moral to manipulate someone’s illness, but then again, you didn’t sign up for a career in ethics, did you?
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]家庭[/b][/size]

我们每个人都有家庭。我们中的许多人与他们相处并不融洽，但我们不会不帮助他们。工蜂也有家庭(顺便说一句，《工蜂也有家庭2》是2050年代的一场短暂的政治运动，旨在要求公司为员工的家庭提供福利)。狂奔者可以通过街头或矩阵了解工蜂的家庭情况。

只要有足够大的家庭，就总能找到可以利用的东西。只需要找到那个东西，并对其施加压力。当然，如果有人这样对待你，你也不会高兴，但你足够聪明，可以过上离群索居的生活。

[spoiler]
[size=12pt][b]FAMILY[/b][/size]

We all have one. Many of us don’t get along with them, but there’s little we wouldn’t do to help them. Drones have families too (incidentally, Drones Have Families 2 was a short-lived political movement in the 2050s seeking corporations to provide benefit to extended families of employees). A runner can get the skinny on a drone’s family on the street or in the Matrix.

Given a big enough family, there’s always something there to exploit. Just find that thing and lean on it, hard. Sure, you wouldn’t like it if someone did it to you, but you’re smart enough to live off the grid.

[quote]
[size=14pt][b]渗流[/b][/size]

“渗流”是2070年代的一种特殊现象，与多种BTL的心理交互作用有着密切关系。在这种情况下，假想人格的要素会“渗入”用户的心理。从而产生了一种精神分裂状态，在高压情况下，这会导致假想人格显现于用户的自然心智之上。

这种情况会让人陷入迷惑、疏远他人，但很少会造成危险。只有0.01%的人在经历渗流现象后会产生暴力反应。2060年代中期发生的“狙击手斯莱德”谋杀案就是这种罕见事件的一个被过度使用的例子。然而，对这起事件和其他事件的宣传却让公众相信它们远比实际情况常见。

在暴食屋中，卡尔经历了一次渗流事件。他在《觉醒：1949》中扮演的角色是一名在另一场第二次世界大战中作战的老练的美国士兵。这名角色对战斗已经习以为常，并且有一种冷酷的、近乎反社会的心理。

这款游戏大受欢迎，竞争对手指控平行控制工作室(Parity Control Studios)在游戏中采用了BTL技术，导致玩家成瘾。这一点尚未得到证实。

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]SEEPAGE[/b][/size]

Seepage is a particularly 2070s phenomenon related to various psychological interactions with any number of better-than-life chips. In this case, elements of the assumed personality “seep” into the user’s psyche. This creates a schizoid state which, under high-pressure circumstances, can cause the fake persona to manifest over the natural psyche of the user.

The event is disorienting and alienating, but rarely dangerous. Only 0.01 percent of those who experience seepage react in a violent manner. The “Slade the Sniper” murders of the mid 2060s are an overused example of such rare events. However, the publicity afforded that and other incidents causes the public to believe they are far more common.

At the Stuffer Shack, Karl experienced an incident of seepage. The character he plays in Awakening: 1949 is a grizzled American GI fighting in an alternate World War Two. The character is inured to combat and has a cold—almost sociopathic—psychology.

The game is immensely popular, and rival studios have accused Parity Control Studios of incorporating BTL technology in the game to cause addiction. This has yet to be proven.

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]卡尔：状态检查[/b][/size][/color]

所以，让我们回到暴食屋。卡尔眼中闪过一丝冷酷，但他没有崩溃，我发现自己深吸了一口气，因为他保持了控制。不知何故，他始终保持着镇定。在他失踪后，进一步的背景调查表明，他具有军人的心理特征。他确实被错误归类了。

两具尸体冰冷地躺在暴食屋外的人行道上，被游侠骑士击毙，他们来得相当快，行动毫不犹豫。他们要扣留我们问话。不管卡尔在店内经历了什么渗流，现在都已经消失了，取而代之的是一种电子游戏角色永远不会感受到的恐慌：再次迟到的恐慌。

游侠骑士给了卡尔一个上班迟到的借口，他希望他们在企业界的地位能够在奥尔布赖特那里产生足够的影响。卡尔和我刚做完陈述，他就飞奔着冲过马路，扑到一辆出租车前。出租车停了下来，我们挤了进去，卡尔大声喊着办公室的地址，把他的信用棒塞进了破旧的铝制插槽里。“快点！快点！”

虽然不够快，但事实证明这并不重要。

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]KARL: STATUS CHECK[/b][/size][/color]

So back to the Stuffer Shack. Karl has that look in his eye, but he doesn’t crack, and I find myself taking a deep breath as he retains control. He remains calm, somehow. After his disappearance, further background research indicated that Karl has the psych profile of a soldier. He was very misfiled indeed. 

Two bodies cool on the pavement outside Stuffer Shack, taken down by Knight Errant who came pretty quick and acted without much hesitation. They are holding us for questioning. Whatever seepage Karl experienced inside is gone, replaced by a panic no video game character would ever feel: the panic of once again being late.

KE gives Karl an excuse for work and, he hopes their stature in the corporate world will pull enough weight with Albright. As soon as Karl and I finish giving our statements, he bolts across the street and throws himself in front of a cab. The cab stops, we pile in and Karl shouts the address of the office, jamming his credstick into the battered aluminum slot. “Fast! Fast!”

It’s not fast enough, but it turns out that doesn’t matter.

[size=14pt][b]掌控工蜂[/b][/size]

操纵公司的工蜂，或者把他们变成永久资产，并不总是一件容易的事。在这样做的过程中，狂奔者要求他们放弃工蜂所背弃的企业生活中的一切舒适。任何希望利用工蜂的狂奔者都必须理解工蜂的出发点。

工蜂的生活是有保障的。虽然这种生活也许不是暗影所能提供的，但却往往是他们所安于甚至喜欢的生活。这就是为什么许多建议都侧重于工蜂对系统表现出的不满。这不应与抱怨混淆。所有的工蜂都会抱怨。这是作为工蜂(甚至是人类)的一部分，但这并不意味着他们想要离开。

要想让工蜂背叛他们的企业主子，狂奔者必须付出艰辛的努力。狂奔者收集到的关于目标的信息越多，成功策反他们的机会就越大。无论工蜂是一次性收益还是永久资产，狂奔者都必须对其个别对待。

这与工蜂的刻板印象是对立的(毕竟，他们被称为工蜂是有原因的)。然而，每名工蜂都是独立的个体，正如我们在卡尔的例子中所展示的那样。卡尔正在寻找更广阔的生活，一个充满刺激的生活，即使他还没有对自己说出口。再加上他不断下滑的表现，卡尔作为一笔资产的时机已经成熟。

[size=14pt][b]DRONE HANDLING[/b][/size]

Manipulating a corp drone, or turning them into a permanent asset, is not always an easy thing. In so doing, a runner asks them to abandon all the comforts of corporate life the drone turned their back upon. Any runner hoping to use one has to understand where the drone is coming from.

The drone has a guaranteed life. It may not be the sort of life that the shadows offer, but it is often a life they are comfortable with, if not fond of. That is why many of the suggestions focus on drones evidencing dissatisfaction with the system. This should not be confused with complaining. All drones complain. It is part and parcel of being a drone (or even a human), but that does not mean they want out.

A runner has to work hard to get a drone to turn against their corporate master. The more data the runner can gather on the subject, the better chance of turning them. Whether the drone is a one-time benefit or a permanent asset, shadowrunners must approach each individually.

This is antithetical to the stereotype of the drone (after all, they are called drones for a reason). Yet each is an individual, as our piece on Karl shows. Karl is someone looking for a bigger life, one with excitement, even if he hasn’t vocalized it to himself yet. Add his slipping performance, and Karl is ripe for use as an asset.

[size=14pt][b]间谍工蜂[/b][/size]

在寻找可以利用的工蜂时，双面间谍和三面间谍并不是人们首先想到的，但这并不意味着他们不存在。不止一个暗影狂奔者以为他们操纵了一个无助的工蜂，结果发现对方要么是企业安插的卧底，要么更糟糕，是竞争对手公司的特工。操纵者很容易迅速变成被操纵者——无论是在暗影中还是暗影外。

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]SPY DRONES[/b][/size]

Double and triple agents aren’t the first thing that comes to mind when seeking out a drone to leverage, but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. More than one shadowrunner believed they manipulated a hapless drone only to find they were either a plant for the corporation or, even worse, an operative for a rival corporation. The manipulator can become the manipulated all too quickly—in and out of the shadows.

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]下午[/b][/size][/color]

当我们回到公司，卡尔迎来了他今天的第一份好运，他发现奥尔布赖特正在她的办公室里和两个人商谈。这两个人看起来像是公司的保安，而她的神情看起来也不像平时那样趾高气扬。

卡尔坐进他的自我调节的椅子，调出了一个显示屏，快速浏览着客户名单——他的客户。这里的每个销售人员都负责自己的客户。当卡尔在可视化的电子表格中高速浏览时——在我这个外人看来，这些电子表格就像糖果般五彩缤纷的乐谱——一个巨大且模糊，有点像老鼠的头像出现在屏幕上。这个动画角色就是部门的销售AI。他的正式名字是维克托里(Victory)，但员工们都称他为多布(Dob)先生。顺便一提，在休息室的冰箱上有一份关于这个问题的备忘录，提醒大家不要叫他多布先生，因为三津滨拥有这个商标。

“嘿，伙计，"维克托里说。“看来你的一个客户想离开我们转投花园成长公司了。天哪，我对此感到非常遗憾。是时候给他打个电话了，对吧，卡尔？”多布先生的脾气很好，就像一个只是在朗读自助书籍的AI生活顾问。

多布开始帮卡尔拨打电话，卡尔则拿起了他的虚拟眼镜。他递给我一副公司提供的眼镜，以便我能参与其中。

办公室的景象开始模糊，然后逐渐消失，就像蜡烛燃烧时伴随着的像素级熔化效果。在我们视野的边缘，一个德克萨斯州的牧场逐渐显现出来。一个大块头男人正在用铁丝网修补带刺的栅栏。他戴着一顶真正的牛仔帽。他转身朝我们走来，擦了擦额头。他的脸色红润，就像一个晒了太多太阳却从未晒黑的人，一头白发修剪得整整齐齐。

“你好，卡尔。你的朋友是谁？”

经过基因改造的野牛在他身后的灌木丛中慢慢踱步。德克萨斯的天空一望无际，那是一种在西雅图很少见的蓝色。

“她是个记者。如果有任何你不想记录的事情，告诉她，否则就别说。”

他拍掉了牛仔裤上的灰尘，那条牛仔裤已经洗得褪色泛白，变成了矢车菊蓝。“我没什么好隐瞒的。”他向我点了点帽子。“女士。”

“你在考虑转投花园成长吗，卡特韦斯？”

这位年长的男人眯着眼睛望着太阳。“你的那些AI确实让你消息灵通。”

“是啊，真的吗？”

“我得考虑生意。你们被一家AAA收购了。我可不指望能得到同样的价格。”

“安德森，我们是唯一一家拥有再生胚胎发育配方的公司。你想让你的小鸡在孵化一周后就被端上餐桌，你还能找谁？”

安德森·卡特韦斯停顿了一下，紧绷着下巴。“问题是，卡尔，我听说大美国公司可能是非法获得这份配方的。也许你们的新老板想停止出售这些东西。”

“你从哪儿听来的？” 卡尔没有错过机会，但我注意到他脸上闪过一丝惊讶。这是他第一次听说这个消息。

“只是一些小道消息。”

“我哪儿也不去，卡尔。”

他们的谈话就这样持续了一段时间，直到卡尔终于说服他的客户留在公司。当我们摘下眼镜时，那个缺乏自然阳光的单调办公室重新显现出来。

“该死，”卡尔说，更多是惊讶而非愤怒。

我问他是否认为卡特韦斯说得是对的。

“我不知道。我需要查看一些东西。你应该去喝杯咖啡什么的。”

我倾身靠近他的电脑，头发轻轻扫过他的肩膀。“机器坏了，记得吗？再说了，完全访问权限。你同意了的。”

他将头从我的头发旁边移开。“好吧。”

[spoiler]
[color=brown][size=14pt][b]THE AFTERNOON[/b][/size][/color]

Karl has his first luck of the day when we return to work and discover Albright is conferring with two people in her office. They look like corporate security, and she doesn’t look her usual, cocky self.

Karl settles into his self-articulating chair and brings up a display, shuttling through a list of client nameshis clients. Each salesperson here is responsible for their own clients. As Karl is swiping through the visualized spreadsheets—looking something like candy-colored written music to this outsider—a large, vaguely mouselike head appears. The animated character is the sales AI for the department. His official name is Victory, but the staff calls him Mr. Dob. There’s a memo about that on the breakroom fridge, by the way, saying how you aren’t supposed to call him Mr. Dob, because Mitsuhama owns the trademark.

“Hey, there, pardner,” Victory says. “Seems one of your clients is thinking of leaving us for Garden Grow. Gosh, I feel just awful bad about that. Time to give him a call, right, Karl?” Mr. Dob is relentlessly chipper, like an AI life coach that only reads self-help books.

Dob goes ahead and dials for Karl who has to grab his virtual glasses. He hands me a pair the company provided to allow me to sit in.

The office blurs, then melts away, a trick like a candle burning down inflected with pixel rot. From the corners of our vision, a Texas ranch falls into place. A large man mends a barbed fence with bailing wire. He wears an actual cowboy hat. He turns toward us, wiping his brow. His face is ruddy, like someone who gets too much sun but never tans, and his white hair is neatly trimmed.

“Howdy, there, Karl. Who’s your friend?”

Genetically re-engineered bison roam the scrub behind the man. The Texas sky goes on forever, a blue rarely seen in Seattle.

“She’s a reporter. Anything you don’t want on the record, tell her. Or don’t say it.”

He dusts his hands off on jeans so bleached they’ve gone cornflower blue. “I have nothing to hide.” He tips his hat toward me. “Ma’am.”

“You thinking about leaving us for Garden Grow, Cartweiss?”

The older man squints at the sun. “Those AIs of yours sure do keep you informed.”

“That they do. Is it true?”

“Gotta think of business. You got yourself bought by a AAA. I don‘t expect I’ll get the same rates.”

“Anderson, we’re the only one that has the rembryo growth formula. You want your chickens on the table a week after they hatch, who else you gonna call?”

Anderson Cartweiss pauses, jaw set firmly. “Thing is, Karl, I hear Great American maybe got that illegally. Maybe your new owners want to stop the sale of that.”

“Where did you hear that?” Karl doesn’t miss a beat, but I note a microexpression of surprise. This is the first he’s heard of it.

“A little birdie told me.”

“We aren’t going anywhere, Karl.”

Their conversation continues like this for some time, until Karl at last convinces his client to stay on with the company. When we drop our glasses, the bland office, lacking natural sunlight, pours in.

“Son of a bitch,” Karl says more in surprise than anger.

I ask him if he thinks that Cartweiss is right.

“I don’t know. I need to look at some things. You should go get a coffee or something.”

I lean over his computer and him, my hair brushing his shoulder. “Machine is broke, remember? Besides, full access. You agreed.”

He moves his head around my hair. “Fine.”

一个半小时后，凯伦·奥尔布赖特出现在卡尔的隔间前。她的脸色苍白，就像一张没有一丝血色的面具。也许那些企业保安真的是吸血鬼。

“你今天下午在做什么？你只记录了一次销售电话。”她试图用习惯性的愤怒来对付卡尔，以此作为支撑她重新振作起来的拐杖。

“我成功地阻止了安德森-卡特维斯转投竞争对手 他是个大客户。你应该感到高兴。”

“那是你的工作，卡尔。别指望因为做了我们付你工资的事情而获得赞扬。” 她迅速地回头看了看自己的办公室。我看到她藏在身后的右手正在颤抖。“不管你在做什么，都可以等等。我需要你整理一份清单，列出你所有每月购买超过一千单位再生胚胎的客户。”

“可以让AI做。” 奥尔布赖特对这个答案并不满意。“我让你去做。”她的声音中透出比愤怒更强烈的恐慌。“快去完成。”

“为什么？”

“你无权问我问题，卡尔，”她的声音突然变得非常响亮，以至于整个隔间里的人都看向她。她努力调整自己的情绪，脚跟一转，回到了自己的办公室。那两个男人依旧坐在那里，面色阴沉，严肃得像个悲伤的民谣歌手。

卡尔像个摇头玩具一样转动着脖子。他又深深地叹了口气，长长的，透着无奈。

我问这样让销售人员整理这些清单是否不寻常。

“非常不寻常。没必要用人工来做这个。”她是在惩罚他吗？她似乎有些害怕。他瞥了一眼奥尔布赖特办公室里的两人。就在奥尔布赖特用手一挥，让窗户变成不透明的同时，其中一个坐到了她的办公桌后面。

卡尔开始工作。

[spoiler]
It’s an hour and half later. Karen Albright appears in front of Karl’s cubicle. Her face is a pale mask, all the color drawn out. Maybe the corporate security goons are vampires.

“What have you been doing all afternoon? You logged one sales call.” She’s trying on her habitual anger with Karl, using it as a crutch to prop her back up.

“I managed to keep Anderson Cartwiess from leaving for a competitor. He’s a big account. You ought to be pleased.”

“That’s your job, Karl. Don’t expect praise for doing what we pay you for.” She looks quickly back at her office. I see her right hand, which she keeps behind her back, shaking. “Whatever it is you’re doing can wait. I need you to compile a list of all your clients that buy more than one thousand units of rembryos each month.”

“AI can do that.” Albright doesn’t like that answer. “I’m telling you to do it.” Her voice carries less anger than panic. “Get it done.”

“Why?”

“You don’t ask me questions, Karl,” her voice so loud and sudden that the entire cubicle farmstead looks at her. She tries to comport herself, spins on one heel, and heads back to her office. The two men are still sitting there, looking dour and serious as a sadcore troubadour.

Karl rolls his head around his neck like a bobble toy. He sighs again, deep and long and redolent with defeat.

I ask if it’s unusual for a salesperson to compile these lists.

“Very. No reason to use organic labor on it.” Is she punishing him? She seemed almost afraid. He eyes the pair in Albright’s office. One sits down behind her desk just as Albright turns the window opaque with a swipe of her hand.

Karl gets to work.

又过了一个小时，一位穿着如刀般笔挺的黑裤子和刺眼白衬衫的男人慌慌张张地跑了进来。

“罗德里格斯先生？”卡尔问道。

“卡尔，我需要……我需要一份所有每月购买超过一千个——”

“再生胚胎的客户名单？”卡尔为他补充道。

“是的，你怎么知道？”

“奥尔布赖特已经问过了。”

“凯伦问的？”罗德里格斯现在显得更加焦虑了。“给我发一份副本。直接寄给我。没必要多此一举麻烦她。”

“我可以把它附在邮件里，抄送一份给你。”

“不！”罗德里格斯似乎对自己的大声叫喊感到惊讶。他压低声音说：“不，直接寄给我。”办公室里的人又一次盯着我们。

“好的，没问题。”

罗德里格斯在离开之前看了一眼奥尔布赖特办公室漆黑的窗户。

越来越奇怪了。

Another hour in, a man in black pants with creases like knives and a shirt so white it hurts to look at comes in frantically.

“Mr. Rodriguez?” Karl asks.

“Rembryos a month?” Karl finishes for him.

“Yeah, how did you know?”

“Albright already asked for it.”

“Karen did?” Rodriguez is more anxious now. “Send me a copy. Direct. No sense in bothering her with an extra.”

“I could just attach it and copy you in the mail.”

“No!” Rodriguez appears surprised that he shouted. He lowers his voice. “No, just send it to me direct.” The office, once again, is staring at us.

“Sure, it’s wiz.”

Rodriguez eyes the darkened windows of Albright’s office before he leaves.

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]打卡下班[/b][/size][/color]

“我们都要去王钟家(Wang Chung’s)，你要一起来吗？” 艾丽克丝的眼睛明亮而欢快，几乎带着恳求的意味。

“我需要去喝杯豆咖。”卡尔说。

“那里有卖的。”

乔治和多蒂，还有其他几个人也走了过来。"是啊，卡尔，你应该一起来的。”

“也许明晚吧。”

“星期天，"艾米悲伤地说。“我们休息”

“抱歉，我真的去不了。”他们独自乘电梯下楼。奥尔布赖特用手印锁上了身后的办公室。她在卡尔的办公桌前稍作停留。“加班是为了弥补你的迟到吗？”她如此问道，但听起来心不在焉。

“是的，女士。”

“完成后把它放在我的桌面上，卡尔。”她没有道别就走开了。她的步伐并不像我之前看到的那样自信。卡尔看着她。当电梯门在她身后关上时，他唤醒了多布，多布闭着眼睛，头微微晃动着，像是在打瞌睡。

“多布。醒醒。”他的眼睛像弹簧一样猛地睁开，多布立刻清醒了过来，变得精神抖擞。

“嘿，卡尔。还在做那个报告？哦，我看已经完成了。那我们为什么还在加班？”

“今天除了我之外，还有人请求过再生胚胎的数据吗？”

“让我好好想一想，卡尔！”一纳秒过后。“四次，”多布说，“两次来自这个地点的内部请求，两次来自我们伦敦分部！”他说“伦敦”时的语气就像在宣布卡尔刚刚赢得了本市的大奖。

卡尔的兴趣被激发了。这是我今天一整天第一次见他这样。他的眼中仿佛有齿轮正在转动。我问他在做什么，他告诉我今天已经结束了，我该回家了。

“你生命中的一天是二十四小时。我还有十多个小时呢。”当我靠向多布时，我的头发再次拂过他的肩膀。

“好吧，你可以看我在家玩《1949》。”他站起身，穿上外套准备离开。

“好吧，好吧。无论你做什么，只要我们俩还活着，你做什么都不能被记录在案。”

“传媒业的职业道德？”他的语气似乎不太相信。

“我保证。”如果卡尔没有失踪的话，我确实会遵守这个承诺。如果他没有失踪的话，亲爱的读者，你就不会看到这部分了。

“多布，谁请求了这些数据？”

“让我查一查——” 多布突然出现了短暂的失真现象。他的脸瞬间变得呆滞，就像是数字化中风。这种情况没有持续超过十秒钟，他又恢复了正常。“抱歉，卡尔。我似乎忘了我们刚才在谈论什么。我能帮上什么忙吗？”

“多布到底怎么了？”我问道。

他回答我：“不用管。”然后对着那浮动的大头说：“多布，周一见。”卡尔抓住我的胳膊，把我拉向电梯。

我提醒他我们有过约定。他点点头。“我们到外面再谈。”

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]CLOCKING OUT[/b][/size][/color]

“We’re all going to Wang Chung’s, you want to come?” Alex’s eyes are bright and cheerful and almost pleading.

“I need to get some kaf,” Karl says.

“They have it there.”

George joins us along with Dotty and a few others.“Yeah, Karl, you should come.”

“Maybe tomorrow night.”

“Sunday,” Amy says sadly. “We’re off.”

“I’m sorry, I just can’t.” They take the elevator down by themselves. Albright locks her office behind her with her handprint. She stops briefly at Karl’s desk. “Working late to make up for your tardiness?” she asks, but her heart isn’t in it.

“Yes, ma’am.”

“Leave it on my desktop when you’re done, Karl.” She walks on without saying goodbye. Her gait is not the self-assured march I’ve previously seen. Karl watches her. When the elevator doors close behind her, he calls up Dob, whose eyes are closed, head bobbing slightly as if in sleep.

“Dob. Wake up.” The eyes snap open like on springs. Dob is very suddenly awake and alert.

“Hey, Karl. Still working on that report? Nope, I see it’s done. Why are we working late?”

“Have any requests for rembryo data today besides me?”

“Let me put my thinking cap on, Karl!” A nanosecond passes. “Four,” Dob says, “two internally from this location and two from our London branch!” He says London like he’s announcing Karl has just won the city lottery.

Karl’s interested is piqued. It’s the first time I’ve seen this happen all day. Gears move behind his eyes, and I ask him what he’s doing. He tells me the day is over. I should go home.

“A day in your life is twenty-four hours. I still have ten-plus to go.” My hair, again, brushing his shoulder as I lean toward Dob.

“Fine, you can watch me play 1949 at home.” He gets up, puts on his jacket to leave.

“Okay. Okay. Whatever you do is off the record so long as we both shall live.”

“Journalistic integrity?” He doesn’t sound convinced.

“I promise.” And I would have kept that promise, too, if Karl hadn’t disappeared. If he hadn’t disappeared, dear reader, you wouldn’t be reading this part.

“Dob, who requested the data?”

“Let me loo—” but Dob momentarily de-rezzes. His face goes slack, like a digital stroke. It doesn’t last more than ten seconds, then he’s back. “I’m sorry, Karl. I seem to have forgotten what we were talking about. How can I help?”

“What the hell happened to Dob?” I ask.

To me: “Never mind.” To the big floating head: “Dob. I’ll see you on Monday.” Karl takes my elbow and pulls me toward the elevator.

I remind him we had an agreement. He nods. “We’ll talk about it outside.”

[size=14pt][b]与网域同步[/b][/size]

工蜂生活的另一个方面是追踪。通过分析卡尔的行为模式，地铁楼梯能够识别出他可能想乘坐的地铁。这种便利适用于整个城市，也意味着技术高超的黑客可以利用这些信息。人们在旅行过程中会留下踪迹，这些踪迹在矩阵中停留的时间并不长，但仍有可能留下模糊的踪迹，比如激活了哪些广告、访问了哪些数据库等等。如果你知道自己要找的人是谁，就可以追踪那些激活的踪迹，看看是否与目标的特征匹配。在地铁上，黑客可以搜索最符合卡尔档案的频道和广告套餐。当然，黑客需要这份档案。她逐渐建立起足够的卡尔个人档案，以便能够在每秒在矩阵中流动的数据洪流中发现类似的模式——就像永远快速向前推进的冰山。

通过这份档案，她可以通过面部识别程序查看卡尔的照片——就像在他的员工证上看到的那样——从而进一步追踪他。不过，这需要进入一家安保公司的网络。这是一种危险的黑客行为。要想更简单地确认卡尔的行踪，可以查看他回家时建筑物的访问记录。或者，我们的黑客也可以在附近的快餐店查找他的“如你所愿”订单。由于工蜂接入了网域，而且他们的档案非常特定，因此黑客可以避免使用一些在城市中追踪人员的难度更高的特殊方法。如果你能悄无声息地潜入蒙戈的甜甜圈世界的收银应用程序，为什么还要去对抗黑IC呢？

所有这些标签对卡尔来说都是一种便利，是他世界中几乎不曾纳入思考的被动部分。但对于狂奔者来说，这却是个人安保的一个巨大漏洞。某人的加美国风格三层糖浆熊爪蛋糕对黑客来说就是一个不断跳动着乞求被利用的追踪符号。

[size=14pt][b]SYNCING WITH THE GRID[/b][/size]

Another aspect of drone life is tracking. By analyzing Karl’s behavioral patterns, the stairs in the metro recognize which train he likely wants to take. This convenience applies all over the city, which means a talented decker can take advantage of the information. People leave a trail as they travel, marks in the Matrix that don’t stay around long but still may leave faint tracesinformation about what ads were activated, what databases were accessed, that sort of thing. If you know who you are looking for, follow the trail of what was activating and see if it matches the profile of the person you are looking for. On the train, the decker could search for the channel and ad package most like Karl’s profile. Of course, the decker needs that profile. Piece by piece, the decker builds enough of her own profile on Karl that she can spot similar patterns in the vast floes of data creeping across the Matrix every second—icebergs on permanent fast forward.

From there, she could run Karl’s pic—as seen on his employee ID—through a facial recognition program to further track him. This, however, requires access to one of the security firm’s networks. That’s a dangerous hack. Much easier to see when Karl gets home, as his building logs that. Or, our decker might look for his specific “Have it your way” order at a fast-food joint in the area. Because drones are on the grid, and because their profiles are very specific to them, deckers can circumvent some of the more difficult ways of tracking people in a given city. Why go up against black IC when you can stealth your way into a cashier app at Mongo’s Donut World?

All of these tags are a convenience to Karl, a passive part of his world he hardly thinks about. For a runner, though, it’s a gaping hole in his personal security. One man’s triple layer UCAS syrup bear claw is a decker’s pulsing tracking symbol, begging to be leveraged.

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]晚间外出[/b][/size][/color]

卡尔一路上不断让我保持安静，直到我们离开了公司园区，朝地铁走去。我脑中闪烁着无数问题，就像游戏节目板在第一声抢答前亮起的灯光一样。到底发生了什么让多布失灵？卡尔为什么对那个在我看来十分普通的数据多次被请求感兴趣？这才是真正的调查工作。

我们沿着地铁的水泥台阶往下走，每一级台阶上都点亮了生物发光的指示文字，引导着人们前往各自的列车。楼梯知道卡尔想去哪。

上了车后，卡尔终于打开了话匣子。他说数据本身很普通，他不明白为什么每个人都对它如此感兴趣，除非这预示着他的部门金鸡奖关闭。但即便如此，为什么他如此紧张呢？

“如果他们要关闭我们的部门，他们就会拿走我们部门中那些他们还未出售的东西。这将是让我们变得多余的第一步。然后，他们就会把我们独有的产品，比如再生胚胎，交给他们的人。该死的，我要失业了。” 他看起来真的很担心，而我不得不提醒自己，这对他来说是生活，对我来说不过是个任务。亲爱的记者们，不要和你的采访对象走得太近。

“多布呢？”我问道，“他为什么突然变得那么呆滞？”

他捏着下巴，思索着。“有人在访问他。”你几乎可以看到他头顶冒出的灯泡，就像那些老动画片里一样。“但他只停顿了几秒钟。见鬼，那是外部的人做的。一个黑客！”他的兴奋之情溢于言表。

我还没来得及思考这个问题，卡尔就在下一站把我拽下了车。“你离家还远着呢。”我说。

他改变主意了，觉得去俱乐部和同事们会面是个好主意。“侦察，”他这样说，显然是在试图模仿他玩游戏时的样子。

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]AN EVENING OUT[/b][/size][/color]

Karl keeps shushing me until we’re out of the corporate park and headed toward the subway. My mind is alight with questions, like a game show board before the first buzz in. What was it that happened to Dob? Why is Karl interested in the multiple requests for data on an item that, to me, is pretty mundane? This is the real investigative work.

Down the concrete metro steps, each one lighting with bioluminescent ideograms directing people toward their trains. The stairs know where Karl wants to go.

Aboard the train, Karl finally opens up. The data is mundane, and he doesn’t know why everyone would want it unless it signals a closure of his department. Even then, why get so excited over it?

“If they were going to close us down, they’d strip our department for the things they don’t already sell. This would be the first step in making us redundant. Then they’d give our unique products, like rembryos, to one of their people. Dammit, I’m going to be out of a job.” He looks worried, genuinely, and I have to remind myself that this is his life but just my assignment. Don’t get too close to your subject, dear aspiring journalists.

“What about Dob,” I say. “Why did he go slack like that?”

He works his jaw, thinking. “Someone was accessing him.” You can almost see the light bulb over his head, like in those old cartoons. “But he went down for few seconds. Drek, it was someone outside doing it. A decker!” The excitement is palpable.

I don’t have time to ponder that, because Karl drags me off at the next stop “You aren’t anywhere near home,” I say.

He changed his mind. Going out to the club to meet his coworkers is a good idea. “Recon,” he says, no doubt trying to sound like one of his games.

[size=12pt][b]专家[/b][/size]

这种工蜂是办公室里的八卦来源。他们通常专注于某一特定领域，一般都是技术性的，他们对自己的专业领域了如指掌，而且总喜欢向别人展示自己的知识。“专家”往往会被吸引到行政工作中，在那里他们对细节的关注得以展现。有时，他们会晋升为部门经理，但更多时候他们能做到的最高职位是经理助理。毕竟管理他人并非他们的强项。

多蒂·波特就是这种类型工蜂的典型案例。

> 你想操纵一个专家？那就给他们一些比办公室八卦更劲爆的消息吧，孩子们。我们都是狂奔者，我们掌握的秘密可比会计部的戴夫干的那些事劲爆得多。让专家觉得：A.你需要他们的专业知识；B.你让他们知道了让人垂涎的秘密，这样他们就会被你掌控了。

[size=12pt][b]攀登者[/b][/size]

赤裸裸的野心是“攀登者”的标志性特征。他们将工蜂的职场生活视为通往巅峰的第一步，他们中的一些人甚至真的取得了成功。

攀登者知道，要想爬到公司金字塔的顶端，就必须踩着别人往上爬，他们通常对此没有什么顾虑。毕竟，道德不会让你得到晋升。

凯伦·奥尔布赖特正是这种典型的攀登者。

[quote]
[size=12pt][b]倦怠者[/b][/size]

他为公司工作至少十年了，或许他当初是个阳光青年，但已经有段时间不再有那种感觉了。他可能厌恶工蜂的职场生活，或者只是感到不满。耗尽热情的“倦怠者”要么在寻求另一家公司的新职位，要么在重新审视自己的生活。

毫不意外，卡尔·杰尼索维奇正是这种“倦怠者”。

[quote]
[size=12pt][b]阳光青年[/b][/size]

她刚从学校毕业，活泼又开朗。这个“阳光青年”甚至可能真的相信公司怀有善意。她可能有潜在的野心，但依然是一个团队合作者。她为公司工作的时间不超过几年。

艾丽克丝·金正是这样一个“阳光青年”。

[size=12pt][b]元老[/b][/size]

他为公司工作了二十多年。在这段时间里，他经历了无数风风雨雨。他之所以坚持下去，是为了退休后的安稳生活。公司对他还算不错，虽然他不是公司的狂热拥护者，但他知道自己的饭碗靠谁来填满。

“元老”往往是优秀的管理者，他们偶尔也会晋升到高层。

> 要想让这类人转变立场，最好有一个足以令人信服的理由。否则，你最好手头有些把柄。元老终其一生都在为退休而努力。

[size=14pt][b]DRONE TYPES[/b][/size]

Puget Sounds! gathered a considerable amount of data to compile the following profiles. All data comes from the years 2066-2075.

[size=12pt][b]THE MAVEN[/b][/size]

This drone is the gossip of the office. Usually specializing in one particular, and generally technical, field, the Maven knows all there is to know about their area of expertise and lets you know it. Mavens gravitate to administration work, where their attention to detail shines. Sometimes they rise to the position of department manager, but more often top out as assistant manager. Managing people is not at the top of their skillset.

Dotty Port embodies this drone archetype.

> You want to manipulate a Maven, give them gossip way better than what they find at work, kids. We’re all runners here, privy to secrets that blow anything Dave in Accounting did out of the water. Make a Maven feel like A) you need their expertise and B) you’re letting them in on delicious secrets, and they’re yours.

> Dr. Spin

[size=12pt][b]THE LADDER CLIMBER[/b][/size]

Naked ambition is the hallmark of the Ladder Climber. They see drone life as the first step on their way to the top. Some of them even succeed.

Ladder Climbers know you have to step on people to get to the apex of the corporate pyramid. They generally have few qualms about this. Morality doesn’t get you a promotion.

Karen Albright is a classic Ladder Climber.

[size=12pt][b]THE BURN OUT[/b][/size]

He’s worked for the corporation for at least ten years and may have started as a Bright Young Thing, but it’s been awhile since he felt that way. He may loathe drone life or merely feel dissatisfaction. Burn Outs are either looking for a new position at another corporation or reevaluating their lives.

Unsurprisingly, Karl Denisovich typifies the Burn Out.

[size=12pt][b]THE BRIGHT YOUNG THING[/b][/size]

She’s fresh out of school, full of spunk and cheerful. The Bright Young Thing probably even believes in the good intentions of the corporation. She’s potentially ambitious but still a team player. She hasn’t worked for the corporation for more than a few years.

Alex Kim is a Bright Young Thing.

> Innocence is what a runner doesn’t have and a Bright Young Thing does. Their gullibility is your biggest asset.

> Dr. Spin

[size=12pt][b]THE ELDER STATESMAN[/b][/size]

He’s worked for the corporation for twenty or more years. In that time, he’s seen it all. He is in it for the long haul and looking forward to retirement. The company has been relatively good to him, and while he isn’t a gung-ho company booster, he knows on which side his bread is buttered.

Elder Statesmen make good managers and, very occasionally they become executives.

> Better have a compelling reason for this type to turn. Either that, or you better have blackmail. The Elder Statesman worked all his life to get to retirement.

> Dr. Spin

王钟家的氛围宛如上世纪银幕电影里的夜总会——铬质装潢和镜面效果都在极力试图还原那个被遗忘的年代。我的手机告诉我，音乐也出自那个时代——新秩序乐团、快乐分裂乐队、迈克尔·杰克逊，这些名字从无人经历的过去被唤起。

乔治、艾丽克丝、多蒂和除奥尔布赖特之外的部门其他人都围坐在一个高脚酒桌旁。艾丽克丝随着她出生前一个多世纪的音乐节拍而翩翩起舞。我的手机不停地闪烁每首歌的信息，但我把它关掉了。

卡尔点了一杯酒，艾丽克丝朝他抛了个媚眼。不出所料，每个人都在抱怨工作。这帮人是典型的“工蜂”群体。如果你想要一个非药物的安眠助剂，可以听几个工蜂抱怨工作几个小时。他们使用的企业术语之浓厚甚至让人觉得自己开始“跳出框架”来思考自己的“附加值”。

就在我听着这些无聊的对话时，我看到卡尔那销售员的一面开始展现。他巧妙地操纵着对话，打听着每个人的想法，试图从中探知他们是不是面临被解雇的风险。

乔治对此不以为然。他说每次发生并购或者风吹草动时，每个工蜂都信誓旦旦地宣称明天的太阳不会再升起。而事实上，它总会升起。

多蒂听说货运部有人与科曼奇黑手党有联系，他们会在发货前在某些条形码上做记号。卡尔特别注意到了这一点。

艾丽克丝整晚都围着卡尔打转。她相信一切都会顺利解决的。随着夜晚的深入，她越靠越近，但卡尔却沉浸在对被解雇的恐惧中。我忍不住怀疑卡尔是否真心享受过他生活中的任何时刻。

这也是许多工蜂面对的生存困境。他们每周工作七十小时，靠逃离这种生活的方式来支撑生活——全息影像、游戏、运动、BTL模拟体验。

卡尔礼貌地笑了笑，付了艾丽克丝的酒钱，然后说他得回家了。

我们打车回到了他住的大楼，他向我道了晚安，并告诉我这段时间过得很愉快，但我提醒他，小瓶妖会陪着他直到凌晨，然后让出租车载我回家，在那里还有一个探视镜在等着我。

Wang Chung’s is the way a club looks in flatscreen movies from last century—all chrome and mirrors trying too hard to evoke that forgotten era. The music, my phone tells me, is likewise of the era—New Order, Joy Division Michael Jackson, names invoked from a past no one here ever lived in.

George, Alex, Dotty and the rest of the department, excluding Albright, sit at a high cocktail round. Alex dances to a beat composed more than a century before she was born. My phone keeps flashing info about each song, but I shut it off.

Karl orders a drink. Alex makes eyes at him. As expected, everyone is complaining about work. The gang is a fair representation of drone archetypes.If you want a non-pharmacological soporific, listen to a group of drones whine about work for a couple of hours. The corpspeak is so thick I’m starting to think “outside the box” and wonder what my “value added” might be.

While listening to the inane conversation, I see Karl’s salesman come out. Maneuvering the conversation, he picks everyone’s brains trying to figure out if they are all about to be fired.

George saw all this before. Every time there’s a merger or buyout or the forecast calls for rain, every drone swears the sun won’t rise the next morning. It always does.

Dotty heard from someone in shipping has connections to the Comanche Mafia and highlights certain bar codes before they go out. Karl takes particular note of that.

Alex moons over Karl all night. She’s sure everything will work out. She slides ever closer to Karl over the course of the evening, but he’s mired in his fear of termination. I wonder if Karl really enjoys any moments in his life.

It’s an existential conundrum a lot of drones face. They work seventy hours a week for a lifestyle propped up by means of escaping that exact life—trids, games, sports, BTLs.

Karl smiles politely, pays for Alex’s drinks, and says he needs to get home.

We cab it back to his building where he says goodnight and tells me it’s been pleasant, but I remind him the bottle imp still has him through the wee hours and let the cab take me back home where a looking-glass awaits.

卡尔一回到家就换上了T恤和运动裤。他拿着啤酒在公寓里走来走去，我猜他是在翻阅白天收集的数据，或者说是他所谓的“情报”。

过了一会儿，他又拿了一瓶啤酒，瘫坐在沙发上，戴上游戏眼镜和触觉手套。他接入矩阵，我花了几分钟才看明白他的那些看似无意义的手势——原来他是在加载游戏。

很快，他就开始和他的团队聊天了——其他玩家也各自半裸着坐在他们的沙发或蒲团上，假装他们的生活很有趣。我了解到，他们正在巴黎参加一场从德军手中收复城市的战斗。卡尔(或者严格来说，他在游戏中的角色)的任务是拯救一群不幸被龙的空中支援烤焦的兽人突击队。

卡尔的双手握着一把隐形枪。“接招吧，德国佬！”他一边喊着，一边击退着我只能想象的党卫军巨魔。然后他猛地抽搐了一下，触觉手套向他的大脑神经发送了伪造的疼痛信号。他中枪了，但他仍在继续。旁观别人玩游戏无疑很无聊——他们看起来就像是在和幻想朋友聊天、对着幻想敌人开火的疯子。

正当我准备去拿一瓶啤酒时，卡尔猛地坐直了。“你到底是谁？你不在游戏里？”他大声喊到，显然，情况有变。

“当然，这是游戏，绝对是。”他停顿了一下。“你说什么？它不一定非得是游戏？”

“对啊，小瓶妖——嘿，你怎么知道的？你在监视我？”

这时，公寓里响起了一个声音，不再是游戏中的声音。一开始是阿拉斯泰尔的声音，但很快就变成了几世纪前的老式黑胶唱片的声音。那声音很诡异，但这正是发声者想要表达的。“那么，卡尔，”那个不真正属于任何人的声音说道，“你愿意真正成为一个暗影狂奔者吗？”

探视镜瞬间变暗，我的观察被一道魔法结界阻断了。对方很专业，但在那短暂的几秒里，我仍能听到那个声音。“那么，卡尔，”它说，“准备好真正地活一次了吗？”

卡尔当晚就失踪了。我去他的公寓查过。据大楼的AI所说，他从未住在那里。他的公司也没有任何他的记录——至少我打电话时他们是这么告诉我的。我试图找凯伦·奥尔布赖特，但被告知：“她不再为公司工作了。”

我又找了部门里的其他人，但只有艾丽克丝愿意跟我说话。她压低声音，仿佛这样可以避开窃听设备。“今天早上我收到了他的一条信息。只有一条短信，直接出现在我家的信息馈送里。他是怎么做到的？他说他很好。他说他正在暗影中狂奔。哦，天啊，新老板来了。我得挂了。拜托你找到他，好吗？”她匆忙挂断了。

在暗影中狂奔，亲爱的读者们。看来是时候让你们忠实的记者深入调查了。祝我好运吧，那片阴影中可是藏着龙。

——您忠实的记者，朗达·恩兹，报道自边缘某处。

First thing Karl does is get into a t-s“hirt and sweat pants. He paces around the apartment with a beer in hand, and I assume he’s rolling over the collected data from the day or, as he called it, “intel.”

Eventually, he grabs another beer, plops on the couch, and applies his game goggles and haptics. He jacks in, and it takes me a few minutes to figure out his seemingly pointless hand gestures are him loading the game.

Soon enough, he’s talking to his team—other players, also sitting half naked on their couches or futons, pretending their lives are interesting. I glean that they are in Paris during a battle to retake the city from the Germans. Karl (or, technically, his character in game) is tasked with saving a group of ork rangers who had the misfortune of being toasted by a dragon—air support.

Karl’s hands hold an invisible gun. “Take that, Jerry,” he shouts, while mowing down what I can only imagine are SS trolls. Then he jerks violently, the haptics sending faux pain signals to his brain. He’s been shot, but he keeps going. It’s boring to watch someone else play a game—they simply look like a crazy person talking to imaginary friends and shooting imaginary enemies.

I’m about to get myself a beer when Karl sits bolt upright. “Who the hell are you? You aren’t in the game?” he says. Clearly, something has changed.

“Yes it is. It’s most definitely a game.” Pause. “What do you mean it doesn’t have to be?”

“Yeah, the bottle imp I— Hey, how do you know that? Are you spying on me?”

Then a voice fills the apartment, no longer in game. It starts as Alastair but quickly becomes that of a tinny, old-time vinyl record centuries gone. Eerie, but that’s what the speaker is going for. “So, Karl,” the not-voice says, “How would you like to be a shadowrunner for real?”

The scrying glass goes dark as a magical ward cuts my access. Professional, but for a few seconds I can still hear the not-voice. “Well, Karl,” it says, “You ready to start living?”

Karl disappeared that night. I checked for him at his building. According to the building AI, he never lived there. His corporation has no record of him either—at least that’s what they told me when I called. I ask for Karen Albright but am told, “She is no longer with the company.”

I try the rest of the department, but Alex is the only one who will talk to me. She whispers, as if she believes speaking quietly enough will foil the bugs. “I got a message from him this morning. Text only, right across my feed at home. How could he get into my feed? He said he was okay. He said his was running the shadows. Oh, drek. New boss is here. I have to go. Please find him?” She hangs up.

Running the shadows, dear reader. Time for your faithful reporter to go deeper. Wish me good karma; there be dragon out there.

Your faithful reporter, Rhonda Ehnds, reporting from somewhere near the edge.
