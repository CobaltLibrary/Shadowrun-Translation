> 了解一家公司不仅仅是了解其领导层。这有助于你了解公司的文化，但在一个大公司中，有着数以百万计的员工，分布在数千个地点，划分为数百个部门和子公司，而身处顶层的人数却很有限。你会更频繁地遇到日常工作的普通员工而非领导层。当你闯入阿瑞斯的研究设施时达米安·奈特(Damien Knight)可不会坐在那里迎接你。当你潜入地平线的公关公司时，加里·克莱恩(Gary Cline)也不会负责那里的安保。因此，我们真正需要首先了解的是一线工人，也就是那些超企为了不断增长的利润而剥削的人，而这些人不知何故地说服自己接受了这一切。所以让我们深入了解一下超企工蜂的生活，看看是什么让他们运转。作为我们的指南，我们将使用《普吉特海湾》(Puget Sounds!)的一篇文章，这是一家数字报纸，出于某种原因，它模仿了上个世纪印刷报纸的风格。我们还将邀请一些了解卡尔(Karl)的嘉宾，正如你将看到的。阅读并享受吧！

> Understanding a corp is not just about understanding the leaders. That helps you see what the culture of the place might be, but in a megacorp you have millions of employees in thousands of locations divided into hundreds of divisions and subsidiaries, and only a handful of people at the top. You’re going to run into the day-today workers a whole lot more than the leaders. When you break into an Ares research facility, Damien Knight is not going to be sitting there to greet you. When you infiltrate a Horizon PR firm, Gary Cline won’t be working security. So the first group of people we really need to understand are the workers, the people who the megacorp exploits for their ever-growing profits, and who somehow convince themselves to be okay with this. So let’s take a deep look into the life of a corporate drone to see what makes them tick. As our guide, we’ll use an article from Puget Sounds!, a digital newspaper that for some reason imitates the look of a last-century print newspaper. We’ll also welcome in a few guests who got to know Karl, as you’ll see. Read on and enjoy!

[size=14pt][b]BY RHONDA EHNDS[/b][/size]

[/spoiler]

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]苏醒[/b][/size][/color]

像往常一样，早上六点，卡尔·杰尼索维奇的公寓AI愉快地把他叫醒。但在这之后他们发生了争论。卡尔·杰尼索维奇睁开眼睛，直视着我们的编辑分配给他的小瓶妖(bottled imp)。您忠诚的记者将在一个小时内与他会面，但《普吉特海湾》想为您提供第一手资料。

卡尔住在皮阿拉普的一幢四十层公寓中，这是一套昂贵的500平方英尺的租赁公寓，专门为企业“工蜂”提供服务。卡尔是一名企业工蜂，尽管关于这个词是否符合政治正确还存在争议。一些AAA超企已经发起运动，试图阻止媒体使用这个词，但《普吉特海湾》是一份独立报纸。他们不喜欢什么对我们来说并不重要。

> 哈哈哈。这些所谓的“独立记者”让我感到好笑。你真觉得他们能在没有公司批准以及大概率存在的赞助的情况下进入卡尔的办公室？如果你这么想，我可以卖给你我的太空针塔，老兄。

> Cosmo

这就是他的生活。他生命中的某一天——而对于那些关心标签的人来说，卡尔对“工蜂”这个词感到满意。

“这是描述这种状况的恰当词汇，”他说。“而且确实是这种状况。我坐在一个小隔间里，淹没在许多其他小隔间之间。我们看起来就像个黄蜂工厂，只不过我们所处的房间是方形的而非六边形的。我小时候曾梦想长大后成为一名富积宇航员，你知道吗？”卡尔身高五英尺十英寸，年龄三十二岁，他的收入是公司工资的中位数。为你提供一些视角，这个工资是公司顶层收入的五十分之一以下，但它也足以供数十名西雅图无SIN者生活一年。您忠实的记者赚不到这么多钱。为了赚到这么多新元，他得做些什么呢？这就是一名工蜂生活的二十四小时的范例。也是你们大多数人没有去选择的那条道路。

> 我爸告诉我过去的新闻业曾经是“公正无私”的。我从没相信过他的话。我凭什么要相信？他还说，在他小时候，新闻主播都没有企业赞助商，我们都知道那纯属胡扯。见鬼，你甚至可以看到在奥利弗·奥尔特加(Oliver Ortega)前额上的阿瑞斯公司标志。

> Sounder

> 新闻报道从来都不是没有偏见的。它所面临的问题是如何处理这种偏见，以及要承认多少偏见。

> Sunshine

卡尔字面意义上地从床上翻滚而起，就好像这一天对他来说太难面对了。踩到硬木地板上后，他眨了眨眼，又抬头看了看天花板。他的订阅源接通了。

“阿拉斯泰尔(Alastair)，”他告诉公寓AI，“请给我来一杯豆咖。”

他的AI以令人担忧的平静与冷嘲热讽的语气回答说：“这个月你没能进入俱乐部，卡尔。一名新租户在投票中击败了你。”卡尔所在的大楼加入了一个名为“哥伦比亚香味”的私人豆咖俱乐部，据说味道比你通常在豆巴克购买到的更像真正的咖啡。每个月，该共管公寓的租户都会匿名投票，决定谁能够获得这种咖啡。这些豆咖俱乐部只发放有限的会员资格，以保证它们的高档。

“他们为什么投我出局？”卡尔问，更多是对虚空发问而非对阿拉斯泰尔。

“你不太受欢迎，卡尔。老实说，你也有些懈怠了。公寓健身房记录显示上个月你只在里面待了六个小时。内部网络上的所有人都可以在投票时看到这一点。”

“我每周工作七十二个小时。”

“说真的，卡尔，拜托。每个人都每周工作七十二个小时。你有一张温暖的床，头上有一片屋顶，以及90.2年的预期寿命。”

“你听起来就像我父亲。”

我会为我们忠实的读者省略细节，但可以说卡尔和阿拉斯泰尔之间的对话演变成了一场争吵。在卡尔淋浴时，阿拉斯泰尔将水温调到了十摄氏度。没有豆咖(因为没意识到自己没能进入俱乐部，卡尔没有在家准备速溶豆咖)，但水温确实唤醒了他。顺便一提，今天早上我不得不在炉子上加热我的洗澡水。

卡尔穿上了纳米级培育棉质衬衫和沃尔玛-香港(Kong Wal-Mart)的领带——年轻高管系列。这在那些有一定抱负的工蜂群体中很受欢迎。忠实的读者，我相信你自己也有一条。<广告>

[color=brown][size=14pt][b]WAKING UP[/b][/size][/color]

As usual, at six o’ clock in the morning, Karl Denisovich’s apartment AI cheerfully wakes him. It isn’t until later that they get into an argument. Karl Denisovich opens his eyes, looking directly at the bottle imp our editor assigned to him. Your loyal reporter meets him in an hour, but we at Puget Sounds! want to give you the raw feed.

Karl lives in a forty story con-apt in Pulyallup, a pricey 500-square-foot rental that caters to corporate “drones.” Karl is a corporate drone, though there is some debate as to the political correctness of the term. Several of the Triple As have mounted campaigns to stop the use of the word in the media, but Puget Sounds! is an indie rag. What they don’t like doesn’t matter much to us.

> Hahaha. These “independent journalists” crack me up. You really think they’d get access to Karl’s workplace without corporate approval and, most probably, sponsorship? I have a Space Needle to sell you if you think that, chummer.

> Cosmo

This is his life. One day in his life-and Karl, for those of you who worry about labels, is fine with the term “drone.”

“It’s the right term for the condition,” he says. “And it is a condition. I sit in a cubicle lost among many other cubicles. We look like a wasp factory, except we’re square instead of hexagonal. I wanted to be a Fuchi astronaut when I grew up, you know?” Karl is five foot, ten inches tall, thirty-two years old, and he makes the median wage for his corporation. That wage is less than a fiftieth of what those at the top make, but it also could feed dozens of Seattle’s SINless for a year, to give you some perspective. Your faithful journalist doesn’t make this much. What does he have to do to take in that kind of nuyen?This is what tenty-four hours in a drone’s life looks like. This is the path most of you didn’t take.

> My daddy told me about the days when journalism was “unbiased.” I never did believe him about that. Why should I? He also said news anchors didn’t have corporate sponsors when he was a kid, and we all know that’s dragondrek. Hell, you can practically see the Ares logo on Oliver Ortega’s forehead.

> Sounder

> Journalism is never unbiased. What it struggles with is how to deal with the bias, and how much of it to acknowledge.

> Sunshine 

Karl literally rolls out of bed, like it’s too much for him to face the day. Once on the hardwood floor, he blinks and stares back up at the ceiling. His feed comes on.

“Alastair,” he tells the apartment AI, “soykaf, please.”

His AI is worryingly calm with a back tone of snide. “You didn’t make the club this month, Karl. A new tenant beat you in the vote.” Karl’s building subscribes to a members-only soykaf club called Scent of Columbia, which reputedly tastes more like real coffee than what you normally purchase at Soybucks. Each month, tenants of a given con-apt vote anonymously for who in the building gets access. These soykaf clubs only give out so many memberships. This keeps them exclusive.

“Why did they vote me out?” Karl asks, more to the universe than Alastair.

“You aren’t very popular, Karl. To be honest, you’ve also let yourself go. The building gym only has you logged for six hours last month. Everyone on the intranet can see that when they vote.”

“I work seventy-two hours a week.”

“Really, Karl, please. Everyone works seventy-two hours a week. You have a warm bed, a roof over your head and a projected lifespan of 90.2 years.”

“You sound like my father.”

I’ll spare our loyal readers the details, but suffice to say that the conversation degenerates into an argument between Karl and Alastair. Alastair then turns the water to ten degrees Celsius while Karl is in the shower. No soykaf (since he wasn’t aware about not making the building club, Karl hadn’t laid in any supplies of instant soykaf in his home), but the water temperature is a wake-up. I had to heat my shower water on the stove this morning, by the way.

Karl dresses in nano-grown cotton button downs and Kong Wal-Mart ties—the Young Executive line. These are popular among drones of a certain aspirant level. I’m sure you own one yourself, loyal reader. <barf>

[size=14pt][b]合群打扮[/b][/size]

许多时装设计师会去迎合企业的着装规范，而每个设计师都试图让自己的服装尽可能符合更多不同的着装要求。这样就诞生了一种乏味、毫无个性的产品，所有真正时尚的暗示都被手术化剔除了。这就是经过年复一年的复刻而提炼出来的经典西服，已经退化到了完全无法让人记住的地步。男士和女士的领带/结是唯一能体现他们个人风格的地方，尽管并非所有公司都允许打个性化领带，但那些允许打个性化领带的公司追踪到他们的员工工作满意度提高了0.08%。

[size=14pt][b]DRESSING TO BLEND[/b][/size]

Several fashion designers cater to corporate dress codes, each designer trying to fit an outfit into as many different dress codes as possible. This produces a bland, generic-looking product that has all hints of actual fashion surgically removed. It’s the classic suit as distilled through years and years of copies, degraded to the point of utter forgettability. Men and women’s ties are the only sartorial spot offering a touch of personal flair and, while not all corps allow personalized ties, those that do track a 0.08 percent increase in employee satisfaction while at work.

[size=14pt][b]THE COMMUTE[/b][/size]

Any drone living outside an arc commutes to work. Advertising lauds Seattle’s public transportation system, but the reality is somewhat different. Karl’s day is a good example of the cognitive dissonance between the hype and the actual experience. You ever see a SINless elf puking in the back of a bus on the billboards?

Today is the first day of the expiration of the Metahuman/Human Jobs Rights Act. The bill expired yesterday and has yet to be renewed by the city.

Strikes are, of course, illegal, but some transit workers have summoned the courage to use one of their precious sick days all on the same day. The lack of drivers is slowing the system down a bit, plus there seem to be an inordinate amount of slow-moving pedestrians today, taking plenty of time to stroll in front of buses, keeping them from completing their rounds. The smart money says that some of these slow pedestrians are transit workers who have called in sick, demonstrating a form of protest in an area where actual protest is not allowed, but no proof of that has emerged. Karl spends ten minutes waiting for a bus. When it arrives, an ork crosses in front of it and then stops, making a show of huffing and heaving for breath. The ork sees Karl looking his way and shoots a glare back.

“Got a problem?” the ork asks.

Karl blinks. “Not me, omae.” He smiles, some of his salesman’s charm evidencing itself, aimed right at the ork. I see the scene go down. Karl and I were supposed to meet ten minutes ago on the metro platform, but the bottle imp 411’d me as to his location when he didn’t show. It’s all wiz, I only got up during fragging daylight hours for this.

The ork looks ready to tussle. I give him the alphanumerics of another reporter and tell him to call her if he wants to talk about anything. He grudgingly slumps away, his LEDs winking in early morning drizzle.

Karl makes an apology about his negligent attention to the news cycle, and we descend into the subway. I let the bottle imp rest on my shoulder; he might come in handy later if Karl wants to have a private moment. We’ve been granted all access, after all. I intend to take full advantage of that for you, my loyal readers.

> Yeah, “all access” so long as their corporate masters sign off on the article. You think it’d have even been filed if it had things they didn’t want included? No matter how much you think you’re seeing the “life of a drone,” I assure you, what you’re seeing is sanitized.

[size=14pt][b]泛人类/人类工作权利法案[/b][/size]

对于那些在过去三周进行媒体屏蔽的人来说，泛人类/人类工作权利法案在之前三年内禁止在西雅图使用自动驾驶公共交通工具。该法案一到期，联络公司就宣布与该市市政府重新签订了合同，并在所有公共交通系统上重新安装了更新后的软件。

年纪大的人可能还记得，本世纪初发生过一场类似的反对出租车自动化的运动。我们都知道结果如何。

[spoiler]
[size=14pt][b]THE METAHUMAN/HUMAN JOBS RIGHTS ACT[/b][/size]

For those of you on a media cleanse for the last three weeks, the Metahuman/Human Jobs Rights Act forbade the use of self-driving public transportation in Seattle for the last three years. As soon as the act expired, Renraku re-asserted its contract with the city, and updated software was reinstalled on all public transit systems.

For those of you old enough to remember, a similar movement took place early in the century against the automation of taxis. We all know how that how that turned out.

“The thrum of the subway is something that synchs with the precise vibration of one’s own molecules. You feel symbiotic down here, a part of the city like you never do above,” Karl tells me. His every sentence is a plea to some other life, though I don’t think he realizes this. We lie to ourselves as much as the corps lie to us.

“I want kaf,” he says. Some truths, of course, seep through.

This morning’s commuter tide remains locked in the private world of their feeds. Twice now, Karl pulled out his commlink only to apologize and sheepishly put it away. I tell him to pretend I’m not here. “We want to capture the raw experience.” “Of what?” “Being you.” He doesn’t know what to make of that, and his eyes
find the subway windows crawling with adverts and news. His gaze causes one pane to lock, showcasing a story about the Tacoma Liberation Front. An elf in a black mask speaks through a voice baffler, “We won’t rest un-
til Tacoma is a Free City, like Denver.” The anchor com-ments about a bombing last week in that same treaty city. The TLF claimed responsibility. The rest of the world scrolls by in the ticker, a multifarious litany of fluff and dread.
I ask if Karl is interested in politics and he shakes his
head, but it’s rare the algorithms make a mistake. Yet, too overt an interest in a terrorist organization such as TLF could get a drone fired. The drone’s life is dedicated to staying within a narrow bar graph of normality. Anomalies stand out and are called up for performance reviews. Karl takes a deep sigh after looking at his phone.
“What?” “Nothing. Just my brother.” Karl’s brother was, like Karl, on track for a corporate
life until he dropped out of Washington State University two years ago and all but disappeared. Karl gets cryptic, and sporadic, texts from him. His father constantly worries. “Never mind,” he says, putting the phone away as the
train stops and two leatherboys from a go-gang get on. Both of their red leather jackets shine under the
train’s incandescents. They prowl the car like lions, eyes crawling over each of us. They settle on a smaller woman sitting across from us and start to hassle her. Karl starts blinking rapidly, like some kind of allergic
reaction. His hands twitch, but he doesn’t do anything. Karl, clearly, plays too many games. We’ve all seen this
before, haven’t we, loyal readers?
