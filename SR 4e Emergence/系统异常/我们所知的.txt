[color=brown][size=16pt][b]我们所知的[/b][/size][/color]

> 是时候回顾并更新一下这篇帖子了。我做了一些调查，现在我确信自己是对的。在过去几年里，超过半打虚拟脑动者的故事出现在新闻中。而更多相关内容则被当作无关痛痒的琐事后丢弃。奇怪的是，似乎没有哪家大型新闻公司将这些线索联系到一起。我正在追踪其他几个线索，还试图找到Dacheroi节目中Armstrong先生聊聊。你猜怎么着？《难以置信》节目播出几天后他就擅自离开了工作岗位，连他的邻居都没见过他。这样的转折如何？

> Sunshine

> 他可能只是在低调行事。毕竟，Dacheroi的节目可能会给你的银行账户带来些收入，但对你的形象却毫无益处。

> Pistons

> 好吧，我给他的楼栋清洁工塞了点钱。如果他露面了，我会知道的。

> Sunshine

> 街头流传的说法是，不管这些人是什么，他们都与宅客是两个不同的群体。据我所知，宅客都是孩子，而我们听说的这些人都是来自各行各业的成年人。毫无疑问，这两者之间是有联系的。相似之处太多了。但我从来没听说过宅客有“无线心灵感应”的能力，而且我也不确定这是否可能。

> Haze

> 我也认为这种区分可能会是误导。他们有着太多的共同点，不可能完全没有关联。这种新人群是否源于宅客根本无法验证，也没有足够的证据证明其中一种观点。几年前，皮肤链接技术似乎还不可行，再看看我们今天的情况。我知道联络和环球全能科技正在研究短距离植入式广播技术，所以这并非完全是天方夜谭。对我来说，关键不在于这是否可行，而在于如何实现。我们只需要研究出科学的方法。看看宅客，谁会想到人类的大脑能够翻译原始的数字输入呢？很明显，MCT和新网的某些人认为这是有可能实现的，这件事也告诉我他们不是唯一在研究这个问题的人。

> The Smiling Bandit

> 很高兴你这么说，Bandit，因为我也是这么想的。所有关于这些第二代宅客(对不起，我只是讨厌“技术巫师”这个词)的故事都是在崩溃之后出现的，我不能把这看作是巧合。他们的能力来源，不管是什么，一定与重建后的矩阵有关。崩溃期间可能发生了一些事情。也许他们进化了？

> Sunshine

> 确实发生了一些事情——他们死了。大多数人脑子被烧坏了，其他人变成了植物人，而那些幸运儿则得上了AIPS，成了疯子。

[color=brown][size=16pt][b]WHAT WE KNOW[/b][/size][/color]

> Time for a thread update and recap. I’ve been doing some research and I’m now convinced I was right. Half a dozen stories of these virtuakinetics have appeared in the news at one point or another over the past couple of years. More were discarded as duds. Strangely, none of the big news corps seems to be putting two and two together. I’m following a couple of other leads, and I tried tracking down that Mr. Armstrong from Dacheroi’s show for a chat. Guess what? He’s gone AWOL from his job and none of his neighbors have seen him since a couple of days after the Beyond Belief show aired. How’s that for a twist?

> Sunshine

> Might just be lying low. After all, the Dacheroi show might put money in your bank account, but it doesn’t do anything for your image.

> Pistons

> Well, I slipped a few nuyen to his building’s janitor. If he surfaces, I’ll know about it.

> Sunshine

> Word on the street, thin as it is, is that whatever these people are, they’re a separate breed from otaku. To the best of my knowledge, otaku were kids, and the individuals we’re hearing about are all older and come from all walks of life. There’s undoubtedly a connection. There are too many parallels. But I’ve never heard of an otaku capable of “wireless telepathy,” and I’m not sure I believe it’s possible.

> Haze

> I too think that distinction might be misleading. They have too much in common to be entirely unrelated. Whether the new breed stems from otaku simply cannot be verified; there’s not enough evidence one way or the other. A few years back, skinlink technology seemed unfeasible, and look where we are today. I know Renraku and UniOmni are working on short-range implanted broadcast tech so it isn’t entirely out there. To me it’s not so much about whether it’s possible, but finding out how it can be done. We just need to work out the science. Look at otaku, who would have thought the human mind would be capable of translating raw digital input? Obviously someone at MCT and NeoNET thinks there’s something to this, and that tells me they’re not the only ones looking into it.

> The Smiling Bandit

> I’m glad you mentioned that, Bandit, because I’ve been thinking along the same lines. All the stories of these second-generation otaku (sorry, I just hate the term “technowizards”) came about post-Crash, and I can’t swallow it as a coincidence. The source of their ability, whatever it may be, must be tied to the reformed Matrix. Something may have happened during the Crash. Maybe they evolved?

> Sunshine

> Something did happen to them—they died. Most got brainfried, others were turned into vegetables, and the lucky ones got the “apes” and became basketcases.

> 你提到的这一点很不寻常，因为我的代理注意到有些文献提到AIPS与虚拟脑动活动有关。我还没有跟进这件事，但我会的。

> Glitch

> 别忘了，很多人在崩溃期间被困在网上，他们也经历了糟糕的事情。该死的，我的表妹贝蒂还在慈悲医院接受生命维持治疗——她的意识已经消失了。也许这些数字灵魂，或其他什么东西，根本不是宅客，而是那些可怜家伙的残余。鬼知道蠕虫病毒和崩溃对他们造成了什么影响。想象一下，你的意识被困在网上！

> Pistons

> 电子幽灵？合成智能？这听起来很是耐人寻味……

> Plan 9

> 我不知道……那个名叫Armstrong的家伙看起来很像是人类。“街头传闻”并不是你可以信任的东西。我觉得这些技术巫师“投射”到矩阵中的理论至少可以说是值得怀疑的——但这也只是我的看法。

> Jimmy No

> 一种被戏称为“达尔文无线电假说”的泛人类领先理论认为，环境因素不断积累，触发了新的基因序列，从而迫使人类进化到一个新的发展阶段。想象一下，崩溃作为一个奇点事件，促使人类向前迈进一大步，向数字化存在的一次进化。

> Plan 9

> 这在技术上是不可能的——没有这样的事情。矩阵是由你的通讯链的拟感模块创建的共识性幻觉。你不能上传或下载一个人的思维。但是，请不要让现实阻碍了这场有趣的辩论。

> Snopes

> 我不能苟同。我在矩阵中看到了一些东西，这让我知道得更多。

> Puck

> 虽然我很不愿意站在Puck这边，但我还是同意Sunshine他们的观点。虽然我担心这些新矩阵异常的本质，但你不得不承认，这其中一定有什么蹊跷。仅仅是超企正在研究这个问题的事实就告诉我，他们相信未来某处有钱可赚。

> Clockwork

> 或者，也许他们只是在恐惧他们不理解的东西？我猜他们不仅仅是在浏览报表。有人一直在某个地方探查这些可怜家伙的大脑，而且已经有一段时间了。他们成功地把这件事掩盖了起来，真让人害怕。这些技术巫师有多普遍？有多少人处于某种形式的拘留中？没有公司会仅出于好奇心来搜寻他们。这之后必然有一个秘密计划。那些能够不依靠通讯链破解矩阵，并对矩阵有着爬虫类般本能理解的人就是蓄势待发的武器。再次声明，我不认为这些下一代宅客本身是威胁，但如果他们的能力可以复制，或是他们的意志被足够削弱，我们就将面临真正可怕的事情。

> Axis Mundi

> 我一直在想这个问题。也许不仅仅是公司在掩盖这件事。这些二代宅客中的一些人可能已经意识到，很多人都会害怕他们的能力。众所周知人们对"地精化"的糟糕态度，60年过去了，人们也仍然对法师心存疑虑。我确信麻烦即将到来。

> Fianchetto

> 是啊，想想看。如果你们是对的，鬼知道有多少这样的东西在外面。他们可能看起来和你我一样，但你能确定他们还是泛人类吗？让我们都记住，根据故事，Deus创造了宅客，并把他们用作傀儡。没错，一台机器把人们变成了肉体无人机，而且没有人能从外表分辨他们。宅客升级这种事听起来非常熟悉。一定是有什么东西制造了他们，在我们知道那是什么东西之前，我们都应该保持焦虑。

> Butch

> 那么，有谁想大胆猜测一下谁在研究这一现象吗？比新网或MCT更容易接近的人？某个可能愿意与媒体交流的人？

> Sunshine

> 我猜有天演和环球全能科技，但这目前还只是猜测。

> Turbo Bunny

> 我也会把联络列入嫌疑名单——据我所知，他们有一个调查宅客的项目。我不认为你能让那一端的任何人开口。如果这真的是我们怀疑的那样大的掩盖行动，那么他们的嘴巴会紧得像恶魔鼠的屁股一样。我会从另一端开始，走上街头，追踪这些技术巫师，了解他们的故事。或者尝试跟进这个突然出现的与AIPS的联系。

> Pistons

> 好消息，我的编辑批准了一篇关于技术巫师现象的严肃调查报道。虽然我有点奇怪，他折得太容易了，实际上笑了，好像我把他的肩上的重担拿走了。真是奇怪。我会在Jackpoint上记录我挖到的东西，大家都可以在这里发布并添加你们自己的贡献。我会设置一个带有实时AR的代理，以标记可能出现在矩阵上的任何新闻和文章。

[spoiler]
> Strange you should mention that, since my agents noted a couple of references to AIPS in relation to virtuakinetic activity. I haven’t followed up on it yet, but I will.

> Glitch

> Lest we forget, a lot of people were trapped online during the Crash and bad things happened to them too. Hell, my cousin Bette is still on life-support down at Mercy General—her mind’s just gone. Maybe these digital animas, or whatever they are, aren’t otaku at all, but remnants of those poor bastards. Spirits know what exposure to the worm and Crash did to them. Imagine your conscience trapped online!

> Pistons

> Ghosts in the machine? Synthetic intelligences? My but that sounds intriguing …

> Plan 9

> Don’t know about that … that Armstrong character seemed human enough. “Word on the street” is not exactly something you can bank on. I find theories that these technowizards “project” into the Matrix dubious to say the least—but that’s just me.

> Jimmy No

> One leading transhuman theory, jokingly called the “Darwin’s Radio hypothesis,” suggests that environmental factors build up, triggering new gene sequences, which then force-evolve humanity into a new stage of development. Imagine the Crash as a singularity event prompting a huge leap forward for mankind, an evolution into a digital habitat.

> Plan 9

> It’s technically impossible—there’s no “there” there. The Matrix is a consensual illusion created by the sim-module in your commlink. You can’t upload or download a person’s mind. But please, don’t let reality put a damper on such an interesting debate.

> Snopes

> I beg to differ. I’ve seen certain things in the Matrix to know better.

> Puck

> Much as it pains me to side with Puck, I find myself agreeing with Sunshine and co. While I’m worried about the nature of these new Matrix anomalies, you have to admit there’s something to it. Just the fact that the megas are looking into this tells me they believe there’s nuyen to be made somewhere down the line.

> Clockwork

> Or maybe they’re just afraid of something they don’t understand? My guess is they’re not just skimming screamsheets either. Someone somewhere is poking these poor bastards’ brains and has been for a while. That they’ve succeeded in keeping this thing hushed up is frightening. How common are these technomancers? How many are in some form of custody? No corporation is just going to prod them out of curiosity. There’s an agenda here. People who can hack the Matrix without a link, and possess an intuitive, reptilian understanding of the Matrix are weapons waiting to happen. Again, I don’t think these next-gen otaku are a threat in their own right, but if their abilities are replicable, or if their will is beaten down enough, we could be facing something truly scary here.

> Axis Mundi

> I’ve been thinking about that. Maybe it’s not just the corps keeping a lid on this thing. Some of these otaku2 may have figured out that a lot of people are going to be damn scared of their abilities. God knows humanity didn’t take well to Goblinization and people are still suspicious of mages 60 years on. I definitely see trouble on the horizon.

> Fianchetto

> Yeah, think about it. If you guys are right, Spirits know how many of these things are out there. They may look like you and me, but are you certain they’re even metahuman anymore? Let’s all remember that according to the stories, Deus created otaku and used them as puppets. That’s right, a machine was transforming people into meatsack drones and nobody looking at them could even tell. This otaku upgrade thing sounds scarily familiar. Something had to make them, and until we know what that something is, we should be worried.

> Butch

> So anyone want to hazard a guess as to who might be exploring this phenomena? Someone more accessible than NeoNET and MCT? Someone who might be willing to talk to the press?

> Sunshine

> I’d guess Evo and Universal Omnitech, but it’s speculation at this point.

> Turbo Bunny

> I’d add Renraku to the usual suspects too—from what I recall they had a program to investigate otaku. Not that I think you’ll get anyone to talk at that end of the equation. If this really is as big a cover-up as we suspect, then lips are going to be puckered tighter than a devil rat’s ass. I’d start at the other end, take to the streets, track down some of these technomancers, get their stories. Or try to follow up on this AIPS connection that’s cropped up.

> Pistons

> Good news, my editor has authorized a serious investigative piece on the technomancer phenomenon. I’m weirded out, though. He folded too easily, actually smiled like I’d taken a weight off his shoulders. Go figure. I’ll be keeping a log of what I dig up here on Jackpoint and everyone’s free to post to it and add your own contributions. I’ll be setting up an agent with a live AR feed to flag any news items and articles that might appear on the Matrix.
