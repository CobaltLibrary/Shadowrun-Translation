[b]Emil Dacheroi：[/b]“欢迎收看我们的节目，虔诚的信徒们！今晚的节目将揭示我们这个时代最难以捉摸、最引人入胜的谜团之一，即所谓的“虚拟脑动者”，“宅客二代”，或我个人最喜欢的“超链者”。但是，在我们深入探讨我们所准备的惊喜之前，让我们把时光倒流，为那些没有收看我们去年的《矩阵之谜付费特辑》的观众解释一下“宅客”这个概念。

到了五十年代中期，关于“矩阵之子”的谣言在矩阵用户中广为流传。根据都市传说，这些街头顽童能够直接用他们的意念操纵矩阵，而无需借助拟感界面和赛博碟板技术。更让人瞠目结舌的是，这些孩子们在进入青春期后就神秘地失去了他们那惊人的能力——就好像成长本身还不够艰难似的。

多年来，这类报道都被视为稀奇古怪的都市传说——比如大脚怪或尼斯湖目击事件——但当轶事证据浮出水面，这些孩子确实存在，并且聚集在黑客部落中，其中一些人从事犯罪活动时，它们很快就变得令人担忧了。其中一个组织“和平行动”(Ex Pacis)甚至上了联邦调查局(FBI)的“黑客帝国犯罪”(Matrix Crime)观察名单。在1964年经济大崩溃前不久，御宅族部落之间似乎爆发了某种帮派战争，导致了几起年轻的御宅族儿童被大规模杀害的事件。具有讽刺意味的是，臭名昭著的冬夜邪教似乎在一些针对御宅族的袭击中发挥了作用。然而，考虑到64年股灾中病毒攻击的独特性质，一些政府消息人士认为，一定是一群宅男与冬夜密谋制造了这次袭击。真相可能永远不会为人所知，因为在aſt金融危机爆发后，有关御宅族活动的报道逐渐消失。有一段时间。

多年来，这类报道一直被当作虚构的都市传说，就像大脚怪或尼斯湖水怪的目击事件，但当轶事证据浮出水面，证明这些孩子确实存在，并聚集在黑客部落中，其中一些还从事犯罪活动时，这些报道很快变得令人担忧。Ex Pacis，就是这样一个组织，甚至上了联邦调查局的矩阵犯罪观察名单。就在 64 年大崩盘前不久，御宅族部落之间似乎爆发了某种帮派战争，导致了几起御宅族儿童被集体杀害的事件。具有讽刺意味的是，臭名昭著的 "永夜邪教 "似乎也在一些针对御宅族的袭击中扮演了角色。然而，鉴于 "64 年撞车事件 "中病毒攻击的特殊性，一些政府消息来源认为，御宅族中的一个派别肯定与 "永夜教 "合谋制造了这一事件。真相可能永远不得而知，因为在撞机事件发生后，有关御宅族活动的报道逐渐消失了。有那么一段时间

For years, such reports were treated as fanciful urban legends—like a Bigfoot or Loch Ness sighting— but they quickly became worrisome when anecdotal evidence surfaced that these children truly did exist and were gathering in hacker tribes, some of which were engaged in criminal activity. Ex Pacis, one such group, even made the FBI’s Matrix Crime watchlist. Shortly before the Crash of ’64, some sort of gang war seems to have fl ared between otaku tribes, leading to several situations where young otaku children were mass-murdered. Ironically, the infamous Winternight cult seems to have played a role in some attacks on otaku tribes. Given the unique nature of the viral attack involved in the Crash of ’64, however, some government sources consider that a faction of otaku must have conspired with Winternight to bring it about. Th e truth may never be known, since in the aſt ermath of the Crash, reports of otaku activity petered out. For a while.

四年过去了，新的令人困惑的报道称，在第二次坠机事件之后，人们出现了奇怪的超能力。尽管看起来难以置信，但直到今天，这种说法仍然没有得到证实和证实!

自第二次撞机事件后，出现了关于人们发展出奇异通灵能力的令人费解的新报道以来，已经过去四年了。尽管看起来令人难以置信，但这种说法仍未得到证实--直到今天！

It’s been four years now since new and baffling reports emerged of people developing strange psychic abilities following the Second Crash. Incredible though it may seem, such claims remain unsubstantiated and unproven—until today!

如果我们相信谣言，女士们先生们，尼斯湖水怪长出了翅膀。在全球范围内，关于遭遇第二代宅男的报道层出不穷。这些新的宅男——如果你愿意的话，也可以说是这些技术人员——已经成为网络空间的臭鼬猿。如果是在一百年前，我们肯定会有模糊的照片和粗糙的低保真录像。但这是一个新时代，证据往往被公众的信念所压倒;共识胜过有效性。

女士们，先生们，如果我们相信传言，那么妮丝已经长出了翅膀。在全球范围内，有关第二代宅男的报道层出不穷。这些新的御宅族--如果你愿意的话，这些技术狂人--已经成为了网络空间的臭鼬猿。如果是在一百年前，我敢肯定，我们会有模糊的照片和粗糙的低保真录像。但这是一个新时代，在这个时代，证据往往被公众的信仰所压倒；在这个时代，共识战胜了有效性。

If we’re to believe the rumor mill, ladies and gentlemen, Nessie has grown wings. Across the globe, reports are fi ltering in of encounters with a second generation of otaku. Th ese new otaku—these technomancers if you will—have become the skunk apes of cyberspace. Were this a hundred years ago, we’d have blurry photographs and scratchy lo-fi video recordings, I’m sure. But this is a new age, where all too often proof is trumped by public belief; where consensus beats validity.

许多关于技术人员的说法都被认为是离谱的谣言。然而，我们的研究表明，许多这样的报道来自可信的、正直的目击者，他们没有扭曲事实的动机。根据这些经过我们调查人员审查的信息来源，技术人员可以:

许多关于技术巫师的说法都被视为离谱的谣言而不被理睬。然而，我们的研究表明，这些报道中有许多来自可信、正直的目击者，他们没有歪曲事实的动机。根据我们的调查人员审查过的这些消息来源，技术狂人可以：

Many claims regarding technomancers are disregarded as outrageous rumors. Our research, however, indicates that many of these reports come from credible, upstanding eyewitnesses with no incentive to distort the facts. According to these sources, each vetted by our investigative staff , technomancers can:

用他们的思想进行无线通信。

仅仅用意念就能操纵母体和指挥机器。

随意破坏电网。

使他们的身体非物质化，并沿着电子数据流旅行。

用自动生成的代码编写计算机程序。

直观地发射和修改无线电波。

通过电子方式将自己复制成自主的数字角色。

召唤和命令机器的灵魂执行他们的命令。

• tap wireless communications with their minds.

• manipulate the Matrix and command machines with mere thought.

• disrupt power grids at will.

• dematerialize their physical body and travel along streams of electronic data.

• program computers with spontaneously generated code.

• emit and modify radio waves intuitively.

• duplicate themselves electronically into autonomous digital personas.

• summon and command spirits of the machine to do their bidding.

Unbelievable, you say? Th e discerning mind will deduce there’s a grain of truth to every tall tale! While linking to the Matrix with an unaugmented brain might seem implausible at fi rst sight, are these abilities truly impossible? Beyond Belief has dug up some surprising answers, tune in to the second half of this special next week [click for your local trid schedule].

And now we’d like to introduce our special guest, Mr. William Armstrong. [applause] Welcome to our show William.

[b]William Armstrong:[/b] Pleased to be here, Emil. 

[b]Emil Dacheroi:[/b] Mr. Armstrong is a clerk at the Snohomish central Post Offi ce right here in Seattle, and he claims to be able to do some pretty amazing stuff with the power of his mind. Before Mr. Armstrong answers some questions from the Beyond Belief panel of consultants, he has volunteered to demonstrate his abilities for us. [applause]. I’ve had the good fortune of seeing William in action and I can only say this will blow your mind. 

For his first trick, Mr. Armstrong needs a volunteer from the audience. Anyone with a commlink will do. I think … yes … the elven lady in the fifth row … yes … with the red sweater. Thank you for volunteering. Please take the microphone … don’t give us your name quite yet though, just raise your commlink above your head. Thank you. Before we start I’d just like to ensure you that our technicians and staff magician have thoroughly examined William to ensure he has no computer, implants, or magic to aid him. William will you do the honors?"

[b]William Armstrong:[/b] Thank you Emil, and thank you, Miss. Now let me focus … just a few seconds … there. I’m accessing your profi le. Your name is Julia Marie Delaney, you are 27-years old, you currently reside in the Oakley Condos in Renton, you work at Macy’s Electronics … and your online nickname is Lea therMinx275.[applause]

[b]Emil Dacheroi:[/b] "Welcome to our show, True Believers! Tonight’s show will shed some light on one of the most elusive and intriguing mysteries of our time, the so-called "virtuakinetics," "Otaku 2," or my personal favorite, "technomancers." But, before we delve into the surprises we have in store, let’s roll back time and address the idea of the "otaku" for those of you who didn’t catch our [u]Matrix Mysteries Pay-Per-View Special[/u] last year.

By the mid-Fifties, rumors of strange and mischievous "Children of the Matrix" became quite widespread among Matrix users. According to urban legend, these street urchins were able to manipulate the Matrix directly with their minds, without resorting to simsense interfaces and cyberdeck technology. What really topped that chestnut was the claim that the children mysteriously lost their amazing ability upon hitting puberty—as if growing up wasn’t hard enough. 

For years, such reports were treated as fanciful urban legends—like a Bigfoot or Loch Ness sighting— but they quickly became worrisome when anecdotal evidence surfaced that these children truly did exist and were gathering in hacker tribes, some of which were engaged in criminal activity. Ex Pacis, one such group, even made the FBI’s Matrix Crime watchlist. Shortly before the Crash of ’64, some sort of gang war seems to have fl ared between otaku tribes, leading to several situations where young otaku children were mass-murdered. Ironically, the infamous Winternight cult seems to have played a role in some attacks on otaku tribes. Given the unique nature of the viral attack involved in the Crash of ’64, however, some government sources consider that a faction of otaku must have conspired with Winternight to bring it about. Th e truth may never be known, since in the aſt ermath of the Crash, reports of otaku activity petered out. For a while.
